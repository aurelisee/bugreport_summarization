Sentence,Opinion
Kontact is the main application I run 24h/24h and these workarounds are poor fixes that I consider not acceptable for a PIM package.,0
the issue happends on i386 version on santa rosa as well and I didn't see this issue with Weybridge platform. I agree with Albert,0
I now have the nVidia driver running beautifully. Thanks for your help Jose.,0
none of the previous suggestions worked for me.,0
People have stoppef complaining because there has been no change for so long. I ended up changing a perfectly good mouse to resolve the issue.,0
Hi Leann I have tested booting from a live cd. The crash also happens using the live cd. Also it is not stable sometimes it crashes sometimes not. I have attached the /var/log/kern.log.0 file. I crashed a few times before it booted ok. That is when I copied the file. I don't know if it's interesting but I hope it is helpful.,0
I can also confirm this bug I get pretty much the same command line output as in the description.,0
That's not good as it makes internal servers unsecure...,0
sbg you are right.,0
I have already described my problem as bug 114233. However it got worse now: I cannot even use OSS anymore.,0
for me yes and since it ' s limited scope i would probably not even add a toolbar button but simply add it to the view menu.,0
We can still give them icons by hand but unfortunately the places menu ignores those icons!,0
I am getting the same error on xubuntu release candidate with all updates,0
I've upgraded to 7.10 and the bcm4306 driver no longer works properly.,0
henry thank you for the useful comment.,0
Need to reopen this. Anything that forces a hard reboot is a bad bug...,0
The good news is that the CPU fan problem described in Bug 127772 appears fixed so I marked that one taken care of.,0
the patch above didn't go smoothly and i can't justify working more on it during work time,0
agreed! a laptop without a decent wireless connection is a big problem!,0
Its not yet fixed so we may have to wait for that as well.,0
Regarding the filter idea: it sounds good to me but I think we should move the discussion about it to a separate bug.,0
That said I'm not sure the video plugin is actually terribly useful now - the big Xv-with-Compiz bugs have mostly been fixed in the drivers.,0
Okay I'm sure your workaround is the way to go it's just the implementation which doesn't seem to be the same between my computer and yours.,0
And after hundreds of that messages I can not use DVD-ROM. DVD-ROM locks. When it has CD or DVD inside - that errors do not appear.,0
Excellent idea!,0
I won't do it myself as I'm not a member of the team,0
"i agree with sergio ""i think that the importance [should] be related...",0
With 6+ hours of battery life I don't think it's dangerous to update the apt database without the AC adapter connected.,0
Confirming this bug (Gutsy). Worked fine in Feisty.,0
no i wouldn ' t think so - bug 121623 is just a way of passing context but it doesn ' t change how decoration is done,0
John the Sun Java 6 Update 1 packages work perfectly and they cause no memleak. I am using eclispe for a long time and it's working perfectly.,0
Just so people know there doesn't seem to be any need to update the display driver just mesa and the DRI driver (and libdrm). Unfortunately current git master has a pretty massive bug that breaks display of textures when auto-generation of mip-maps is use,0
This bug is now fixed in the latest Linux kernel git.,0
it's not a super common bug but when it hits the results are brutal.,0
ok i agree that fixing it is better than removing.,0
that's not an evolution bug,0
I have the same problem and work with the same unit (LT2610) as Guillaume has. I had installed with the latest *buntu distro (hardy) with the lates geode driver(2.9) but still no luck.,0
on my m1330 neither internal or external microphones are working!,0
agreeing with dimitrios -- such packages should be removed fixed or moved to a broken-packages repository if you want a place to put them aside for interested community members to take a shot at fixing them.,0
Just tried Samir's suggestion of removing dosfstools and it did not help.,0
sounds good from the description,0
it looks like you are also counting empty lines which doesn ' t seem overly useful to me.,0
Yes thanks very much for eclipse 3.4 in karmic.,0
Dear Kjell Braden I still have the issue of not being able to restore from created aptond.,0
Hmm Rocko sounds so good ;),0
Thanx for the info. Sorry I can't help.,0
I found the same as anthony. Running sudo aptitude purge xserver-xgl fixed the problem for me,0
And please don't reset the bug to new.,0
Bug has disappeared after upgrading to kernel 2.6.22-7. Good work!,0
i don ' t have a consistent set of steps to reproduce the issue although i think it may be related to moving from one line to the next,0
I'm using 2.6.22.9 and the performance is pretty good even several meters away. Much better than previous 2.6.22 kernels.,0
Kubuntu 7.10 x86 Updated Flash player yesterday after which Flash wouldn't work in Firefox.,0
I've added initial atom and rss2 capabilities to the document listings. This can be tested on the test zope on arana. The way to get the feeds for now is to append /atom or /rss2 to the url of the document listing object.,0
I don't have to touch the theme settings or anything. Some of the differences are just relocated elements but there are also several new elements describing the following,0
i've tested and it and it works.,0
Brian this fix wasn't released in time for the beta!,0
Yes I can still reproduce this.,0
i don't think it is necessary to touch the other entries than vesa at least not for gutsy.,0
In case it helps here's a debdiff applying Peter Clifton's EXTRA_CFLAGS fix. I can confirm that it fixes my sound,0
unfortunately this doesn't fix the other problems such as java and evolution as james has pointed out.,0
I agree auto dectect string encoding is difficult especially short string like audio file tags there no perfect solution.,0
the old driver is not only breaking my X-System but also my balls . No point having an updated driver that doesn't actually work.,0
thanks peter. i agree with you. i ll move the request to kdelibs even if i m against too.,0
mitch: i do not have that problem with the usplash,0
at the moment i am happy with this workaround solution.,0
i cant get back to f7 and top shows xorg eating 100% of the cpu.,0
This looks like it is fixed in the Hardy alpha 2 with the 2.6.24 kernel. The newer b43 driver seems to work quite well.,0
It doesn't add the job number; it replaces the document name with a job number which is why it's not an acceptable default.,0
It's fixed for me in Intrepid updated.,0
Desktop effects are not enabled. This problem is VERY annoying because we are 5 users on the same PC and closing/open sessions all the time is not a long term solution.,0
Yes Sebastien It's fixed for me in Hardy.,0
but I now get errors regarding PnPBIOS.,0
This appears to be fixed upstream (around version 5.10.27) so it should be fixed in Hardy (where we have 5.10.30 currently).,0
Sigurd Hogsbro: It is not specific to the AM64 version.,0
This seems to be resolved. I've upgraded to 9.04 on both my laptops and I haven't had backlight issues since.,0
This patch is not acceptable.,0
The fix explained by dailyglen worked for me.,0
no there's no reason for not applying the patch imho it's clear and safe enough to me (without being a developer/packager of that package).,0
I've got the same card chipset and OS - and exactly the same problem,0
it didn't helps me on 8.10,0
I can confirm this issue....,0
I ran inotifywatch on all of the top level directories and got the following results. I also tried > sudo rm -rf /tmp/* && sync && sudo sh -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' but the performance problem persisted.,0
I've the same problem and I'm getting it with Fedora 7 too.,0
2Rocko: that's strange. It seems to be fixed in 7.12 fglrx release at least for me.,0
Same crash and respawn problem here. The only way to fix this is to shut down evolution which really stinks.,0
Adding a UI element for a few hardware specific issues does not seem like a good idea especially when I can guarantee upstream won't take those patches.,0
I fully agree with Dan here and I also fully admit that I don't have the slightest clue on how to implement this technically :),0
sadly turning of acpi & hpet did not work.,0
The workaround that Peter Clifton posted also resolves the issue I had connecting to my local WPA-PSK secured network.,0
shinyblue: the download link doesn't work.,0
I'm in the same situation that waratah.,0
i dont think that waiting for edgy to be released will work since the problem seems to be related to gnome 2.16.,0
we are now using this feature in gimp trunk. seems to work nicely with intltool 0.40.0. thanks again for this change,0
but given that the livecd is the installation option that is pushed by ubuntu this problem is pretty unacceptable in my opinion.,0
Ah that is helpful. I adapted the script dl-workflow.sh to go to both servers for now and ran it once manually.,0
libopenobex1 does not appear to be available from the main Gutsy repositories. One place to retrieve it from is here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/gutsy/i386/libopenobex1/1.3-3ubuntu1,0
hi david - this patch looks very good,0
i therefore conclude that it is not a very common configuration.,0
The root cause of this is bug 157126 ie empty --with-default-mozilla-five-home passed to firefox configure. It's getting fixed by the mozilla team.,0
Tyson: I don?€?t know about the others but I at least don?€?t mount the home directory.,0
Hi Leann I have tried your suggestion and it worked! I have booted 10 times without a crash. Thanks a lot you made my day! Thomas.,0
"dan: i don't think steve saw your last comment - he said: ""please resubscribe us where there is"" and looking at the subscribers i don't see him or ubuntu-universe-sponsors there currently...",0
It worked fine for me : that damned annoying thing I've had for maybe 4 months has at last gone away !,0
I am not perfectly sure that it is network-managers fault either. I properly removed it but the difference wasn't that huge.,0
Same with the last version see the Bug 136777 It as been nominated for gutsy but it as been marked as duplicate of this ...,0
"i thought it would be nice to have one workspace "" error ""  but i don ' t think that markers on the workspace root will ever appear in the problems view",0
mithro i'm in exactly the same boat as pauleewaulee.,0
new update to alsa-mixer today july 31 but this problem still there!,0
Eclipse 3.4 installed from source works well in Hardy.,0
path but there s no reason why it should since i m falling back to a very standard call to component.utils.import,0
as jani reported above and i can confirm this problem is still there running with fully updated bios.,0
SVN releases of madwifi drivers didn't work for me at all in particular probably because my wireless network is ad-hoc. Although that is supported by the madwifi drivers it just doesn't work for me.,0
i tried it on hardy heron alpha2 and it seems to be working fine.,0
On a Toshiba Satellite U200 sound is OK on feisty and gutsy (without any modification). The only remaining troubles are : - mute as explain in comment 96 of ricolai). Look at bug 151108. - [0-50%] level of master channel that don't work.,0
I just experienced this on Karmic Koala. I took ethical's suggestion to find other running package managers and found Synaptic was running in the background (not sure yet why): A quick 'sudo killall synaptic' solved the problem. It would be nice if the error message emitted by tasksel/aptitude in this case were more specific than 'aptitude failed (100)'. apt-get tells the user if another instance is running.,0
I'm don't think the rotate gesture for switching tabs is nearly as useful discoverable or a good fit as the other gestures are.,0
I've fixed the sound problem on my Dell Inspiron 1420 running Hardy and adding the following to,0
Well mine is not working on my D800 dell latitude. What are the settings that everyone is using?,0
Thank you for your report. we are closing now this report please reopen it at any time if you have more related info. Thanks for your contribution.,0
and unfortunately by now /var/lib/dpkg/updates is empty too.,0
I can confirm this bug on my Thinkpad T60.,0
"I used the lice cd but there is no solution yet: the cupsys is ""old"" and the Dymo was not recognized.",0
yes exactly as it works in all other views that allow linking,0
0.9.7-3 does not fix this problem.,0
I had the same problem too on my friend's laptop.,0
I can't use the workaround as my apt-cache archive is empty.,0
Thank you very much for the help Steve! I would try. I will write as act in Jaunty. I hope soon I can sleep peacefully,0
Thus his post is unrelated to my original bug report for this regression.,0
i agree with this.,0
hello in my case it was not a bug thanks to sa?vann i could correct the problem :,0
i encountered the exact same problem and just like sammiam wrote it was the dfe-350tx+ adapter that caused the problem.,0
"sa?vann carignan i can not reproduce this bug editing the ""kernel"" line (disabling usplash).",0
This is also an issue with the Acer Aspire 6920G notebook.,0
We can't change the package name so close to 7.10 but at least the description fixes are trivial.,0
I have just tested it and it works fine. Thank you.,0
i also tried epiphany and it does not work as well.,0
I believe that it has patches that fix this problem. Thank you. Ted.,0
i don ' t think that replacement functionality was ever implemented,0
I solved. Thanks.,0
hurestore is not a finished program and would better be removed from the repositories.,0
I finally made sound work on Inspiron 1720 and kernel 2.6.22-14-generic by doing the following,0
There is very little point in having +packages if it leaves out uploads whenever it feels like it.,0
Okay I'm sure your workaround is the way to go it's just the implementation which doesn't seem to be the same between my computer and yours.,0
tayhe I think it is unwise to dup evey X-crash bug onto this particular one.,0
Having upgraded to Gutsy transfer speed is a lot faster for me . It is a definite improvement though no question.,0
Hello I could reproduce the bug by reproducing the steps described by LKRaider on the latest live cd (daily - 2008/04/19). However I was unable to reproduce the bug that makes any window opens in background (ie launch 'nautilus' by a shell the focus will be kept by the shell's window).,0
brian tormod you are absolutely right.,0
marco this bug does not meet the criteria for a stable release update and is being marked as won't fix for kernel version 2.6.22.,0
I also get this behaviour i Hardy.,0
but I don't know what that is,0
"Johannes I agree with Peter there is a 180 second delay in the code in an ""if"" block just before the suggested location for the patch.",0
it doesn't work with the setpci-hack and it doesn't work with the normal feisty kernel.,0
Thanks for your hard work on the mtp plugin. So far it works great.,0
but the command doesn't work.,0
Ok I have follow the guidelines and I attached the correct patch. Thanks Martin and all for the help.,0
on my side nothing has changed yet.,0
You're not going to believe this but adding this to the default.conf file magically made it work,0
the method platform.getresourcestring(bundlestring) is not deprecated at this time,0
comment on attachment 525331 new version with a working test i agree that changing the test should make the test pass but it seems like window.close() being invoked inside a content window is still a thing that can happen and should also be tested,0
So as it is not the devel branch (which is 2.6.25) I don't think they have changed something in there API.,0
Thanks for pointing this out. The same worked for me as well!,0
i don't believe that amarok its self does what you're talking about.,0
I have the same problem. No xchat icon. Clean 7.10 install. I'll let you know if it will change atfter a reboot.,0
"For me this is a serious bug. In fact contrary to my previous comment the system won't really boot after this - instead it will give the ""give root password for maintenance"" prompt when it fails to fsck the non-root filesystems (/home etc..) because it can't find the device nodes Martin I have tested your workaround with Openoffice 2.2 and in my Pc Openoffice doesn't start without the package openoffice.org-gnome. I don't know what happen with Openoffice 2.3.",0
I had the same problem too on my friend's laptop.,0
We don't have query mysql-query-browser in 12.04 LTS,0
"It would be usefull to add a \""Swap\"" button to quickly change the aspect ratio between portrait and landscape.",0
i can confirm that updating to the version in hardy-proposed did not fix the problem.,0
HURRAY!! My laptop just booted on 2.6.24-2-generic Hardy Haron kernel!!!!!!!! Thanks to developers.,0
I REALLY have no stomach left for manually compiling packages and sorting out compile errors one by one,0
Horre thx - this seems to be a reasonable suggestion.,0
Sounds like a completely unrelated issue. - mdz,0
As of today I have been hit with this bug too.,0
I think that toshiba a200 does not have same sound card as a toshiba u305.,0
I have the same problem with my ATI card and non-proprietary drivers.,0
so that isn't an option for a fix.,0
Thanks your hotfix fixed this problem however on the past KrushDay someone mentioned a similar issue pressing Alt+PrintScr which is still present for me.,0
It doesn't solve the problem for the INIC-1530L based external hard drive.,0
I agree with Adam: this software is not working at all it's really better to remove it very quickly.,0
Setting importance to high. I can confirm the 'could not open cache' error and reinstalling adept does not resolve the problem.,0
I agree I'd say it's an ifupdown bug.,0
the battery manager does not work correctly any longer.,0
i have the same issue compiz dies if it's larger than 2048.,0
No for me is not still an issue because now i change fax server and i'm not using hylafax. Thanks a lot for all.,0
I am having same problems  Also having occasional stutters in picture,0
I've just retested my D40x. It is still not working.,0
yes you did understand correctly.,0
It worked well in alpha version but not now in beta version. I think that they couldn't fix this bug.,0
Regarding the filter idea: it sounds good to me but I think we should move the discussion about it to a separate bug.,0
I'm in the exact same boat as you craig.,0
This is very useful for those who are not familiar with all options available in the Preferences.,0
but Suspend still does not work. Hibernate works ok.,0
The files are easily associated with the original package because it's part of the file name. Optionally we can add some webservice calls like Celso suggests above. The buildds also need to be changed to strip these files out and put them in the build of course. Job done.,0
"It seems strange that a fix has been in Hardy and for quite some time now and yet Gutsy still doesn't have it. I can hardly imagine that ""stable users"" want the old package seeing as it doesn't work.",0
I'll try the new displayconfig-gtk from the upgrade of today 10/2. Weird thing is that sometimes 'screens and graphics' really sets the 1280x800 resolution so as long as you don't log out you think everything is ok.,0
xjnumb: that's a different bug and specific to the i810 driver.,0
According to related Mandriva bug the problem seems to be with new glib memory allocator. Running vlc using : $ G_SLICE=always-malloc vlc works fine.,0
No problem solved it had to do with reverse-DNS-entry. I am not using it any more so I can not tell any more details about it sorry.,0
yeah i do agree with endolith.,0
i don t think you need the comment here. if you want to keep it then i think we can just make it a generic comment and not mention content/chrometabs directly.,0
Thanks for the report Susan Cragin  It has been a long time without any comment or a duplicate in this bug report and It is possible that the bug has been fixed. Thanks again and we appreciate your help.,0
I find the new way of selecting cursors not too user-friendly.,0
I can reproduce this here on my i830 based laptop with intel driver.,0
a) for me this applet crashes several times a day and i dont think letting apport report a bug every time would help but i dont see any progress here whatsoever...,0
Enable Hardy -proposed and install the -17.31 kernel which has SCHED_CGROUPS enabled. I believe it will have an effect on interactivity responsiveness.,0
What you are referring to is not the same as this bug.,0
I updated to version 1.0.15rc3. I packaged using the 1.0.14-1ubuntu2 patch and it worked as is. I haven't checked on any other cards but it works as a first aid for D630.,0
the problem was obvious so i didn ' t try running your example until now ..but i don ' t think that was the patch you wanted to provide,0
Yes i can confirm that too,0
the fn-f4 combo no longer works to suspend the machine - it doesn't appear to do anything as far as i can tell.,0
Thank you gomek for your info. Please kakashi can you confirm that your crash is the same that has reported gomek (See my last post).,0
So it is not an upgrade problem.,0
I've also used make-vmpkg to make a package of the newest version of vmware player (version 2.0) but forgot to mention that in my previous comment.,0
.anyway i tried your suggestion but it didn't work.,0
I see the exact same problem on my Thinkpad T41p with ATI Mobility Fire GL T2.,0
I don't think the problem is solved - just changed with different mixtures of cards and kernals.,0
try this tutorial it works for me(hp nx7400) (for red hat like change apt-get by urpmi ),0
no way i can reproduce this.,0
while i agree that it is bad to break platform conventions there is one example of a non-modal wizard dialog though,0
peter your solution merely causes the computer to ignore alerts by silencing the internal speaker. this is hardly the correct behavior.,0
Thank you for your bug. Marking confirmed since somebody else has the issue.,0
That's a different bug that only happens when you use the 'intel' driver instead of the 'i810' driver.,0
Thanks marking fixed as per comment 44,0
Nope. My desktop only has IDE drives and so does my laptop so not sata-related.,0
i agree with what mike said - we (it) do a lot of last minute work and would have been able to handle this one too.,0
I have no NTFS Partitions and still get this error.,0
Thank you! I'm glad to see that the 2.6.24-11-generic kernel I recently installed has fixed this!,0
stijn gysemans this appears to be a different problem than originally reported it is better to open a new bug report to avoid confusion.,0
i agree that we cannot count empty comments here by default because comment styles differ by language,0
The classic update manager can't be used to update a plugin installed in a global read-only location. It tries to install it to your user plugin location but when you restart the global directory overrides the user-specific one.,0
It might make sense to determine the initial aspect ratio this way.,0
However Tim that means that you can't possibly have tested the feisty-proposed packages since they did not exist yet.,0
i use hardy.the same problem occoured to me when i had stopped the tasksel in the middle.,0
we should absolutely not change that behaviour and particularly not now.,0
I'm confirming that this bug is currently fixed in hardy.,0
I tried installing ATI Catalyst 7.11 but I get extremely choppy video. Didn't even try to suspend/resume because something was obviously wrong. I had the same problem when installing the previous version of ati's driver.,0
Thanks for the extra information regarding running the command on a non-fragmented file system. Your testing confirms that it is beneficial to have the file systems defragmented before using GParted to manipulate the partitions.,0
hi thanks for doing some work on this but for me it doesn't work.,0
Same here - and no bluetooth devices!,0
there are some facts that are different:,0
Sounds reasonable.,0
a problem with this patch is that the session data is still stored in memory while the app is running and by removing this pref there's no way to disable that.,0
Thank you for fixing this bug so fast so I just need to wait for the next release.,0
That's strange because I've an integrated Intel soundcard.,0
I agree this is a better way of doing it.,0
module is not loaded properly.,0
Had similar issue however I solved my problem by going into compiz settings general options focus & raise behaviour tab then changed focus prevention level to low.,0
i am unable to ssh to machine when it is freezed.,0
I can confirm this on an Asus F3Sv with (K)(X)Ubuntu 8.04 clean install.,0
"I was getting the error and installed the gnome-vfs-obexftp package as recommended. Now I just get a different error. Couldn't display ""obex://[xx:xx]"". Check if the service is available. I am trying to connecting to a bluetooth keyboard.",0
It is very useful tool and I use it weekly to manage my photos and videos.,0
Sslaxx and me can't boot even with the flags,0
I'm pretty happy with openSuSE 10.3 and Mandriva 2008.0 and tonight I will make up my mind on which shall remain in this laptop as I need the rest of the space to try another distro.,0
This seems strange behavior as installing teneo should not interfere with the rest of the eclipse installation.,0
Great!! Thanks and congratulations! I will try this afternoon.Thanks,0
no it is not fixed!,0
i'm in agreement on if it works in windows it should work in linux philosophy.,0
I don't believe the GUI reads your .bashrc so you could set it in /etc/skel/.bashrc,0
yeah that's exactly the problem to me.,0
No it does not. Installing pommed from the repo fixes the display backlight but the keyboard backlight is stilll unresponsive.,0
And yes I am also running 64 bit,0
but so far me and Alexander are unable to reproduce in gutsy and sid Im using 386/686 and im unable to reproduce in the ways you explained.,0
Confirming the ubuntustudio task of this bug,0
The workaround from kesomir is not suitable for me since i don't have access to the ldap-server.,0
it looks good and i verified that it works for internal and external jars and that it doesn t break bug 297039,0
Please don't use bug reports as support forums if you want to ask someone a question e-mail them directly.,0
comment on attachment 444422 small icons in thread view seems to work and looks reasonable.,0
Sorry but this has nothing to do with flash although the root cause might be related.,0
Daniel very quickly fixed that problem and I've no issue with how karmic is today nor with the default being set to off.,0
Its is no real big deal just go to places and computer and remount it takes seconds this bug does not happen to everyone so I've heard but it has been around since at least feisty.,0
Thanks for your effort John. Basically we have a typo in your changelog. Btw I have been using java6 on Feisty and has no problem here,0
Unfortunately it seems this bug is still probably an issue.,0
I still have this problem with Gutsy RC Desktop CD as well.,0
I hadn't noticed that I didn't update xorg-server because apt thought my version was the higher one.,0
I can confirm that the issue still exists in the latest kernel release 2.6.24-8.14-generic,0
Changed back to incomplete since it wasn't solved by Gutsy.,0
Let me tell again exactly like you say here there should be two taskbars one main one and a special icon only taskbar for important/background apps.,0
no the problem has not shown up recently.,0
Seems to be solved by Gutsy.,0
I can't find update-initramfs from the lrm scripts so nothing to fix,0
It seems to be fine in Intrepid,0
The backports module does not fix sound on my D630.,0
comment on attachment 444422 small icons in thread view seems to work and looks reasonable.,0
it is not yet included.,0
Also removing gnome-screensaver and replacing it with xscreensaver fixed the problem for me... although i do like gnome-screensaver much better,0
your problem is not related to this bug.,0
yeah pulling the checker entirely for windows ce would be fine (until such time that users can do something about it),0
Oh. Important note - experienced on i386 so not an amd64 exclusive issue.,0
This appears to be fixed with hardy heron been running without compiz for the past few days and the bug has not appeared again.,0
but i must say that i don't think these bugs should all be marked dups.,0
Thanks proycon Your suggestion seems to have worked for me. Everything looks like it worked and I'm running at full resolution. Thanks!,0
My dell Lattitude D610 sound worked in Gutsy and intailly worked in intreped but nolonger works with newest kernal,0
I think this is a better package,0
still happens on maverick. i noticed it happens much more often if cpu is busy and there is also big network traffic.,0
I confirm this bug for Ubuntu 8.10 Alpha 2 64-Bit on a MacBook Pro rev. 3 fully updated.,0
sebastian kapfer i think that you misunderstood this bug.,0
Martin and Luca I finally had the time to set up a feisty machine. I checked and Luca you are right I can confirm that this bug is obsolete for Feisty.,0
i couldn't figure out a more useful way to debug this.,0
the edgy live-cd works very well for me.,0
Well considering I wasn't able to describe how to reproduce the bug in the original report and noting that the original report was almost five years ago I could not possibly even begin to confirm the continued existence of the bug right now.,0
I'm on this.,0
Synaptic and apt-get can't find linux-backports-modules-2.6.22-14-generic even after enabling the backport repository... The bug is still present in Ubuntu 7.10 RC.,0
Sound does not work on my dell d800 latitude either.,0
possible the new packege is not updated on all mirrors yet.,0
Normally all bugs on kernels must have some information described at: But because of the nature of the bug report I am confirming without it.,0
I've installed it from the ppa (on jaunty) and restarted firefox but don't see the extension listed in the add-ons.,0
Martin Actually I have done some more testing and discovered that when index merging no physical reads were done (they are all cache hits) so ext3 problem is handling a ton of small writes,0
the ops crash seems to be not related with the rest of reports.,0
i'm having the same problem on a Hardy Heron fresh install,0
issue still seen on Gutsy Beta with Dell Dimension 3000 onboard audio card,0
tried solution suggested by danielhollocher it worked,0
After reading again and just have followed a forum link in Ubuntu Forums i saw i maybe have chosen the wrong bug to comment. Sorry !,0
I think I have found a fix for the issue of the garbage at the right/bottom when forcing compiz to start despite the failed texture size.,0
i don't have a focus problem in ubuntu 9.04 jaunty alpha 5.,0
I had the same problem described.,0
this log doesn't look like the latest.,0
I had the same problem with my T60.,0
I still can't change my screen resolution.,0
Jacob: -i810 and -intel have a different codebase both need to get fixed and both work now. There is a bug in the intel driver though that makes video playback crash on older cards (i830 i915) but those cards work fine with the i810 driver.,0
unfortunately it had some bad side effects that caused breakage for people and had to back the patch out.,0
the fix works for me but since we are moving this to 3.7.1 i will hold off on my +1.,0
However when trying to compile the driver as explained by ggepz it fails with many errors.,0
I can just say that I have the same problem. The disabling of the exchange operations plugin does not help.,0
This is still broken in karmic.,0
this patch is quite nice because it makes the markup more consistent and it allows someone to set the toolbar mode possibly attach a palette and so on..,0
No unfortunately the display-brightness problem still remains - at least I didn't manage to make it work.,0
It is a definite improvement though no question.,0
It is compatible to the kernel but it needs a newer python-launchpad-bugs in Feisty. Also I am not terribly convinced that we need it in feisty since we disabled the automatic crash notification by default.,0
the above attached patch solves this bug.,0
i'm sorry but i can't test this fix.,0
comment on attachment 525331 new version with a working test i agree that changing the test should make the test pass but it seems like window.close() being invoked inside a content window is still a thing that can happen and should also be tested,0
This problem is still very annoying to me on Lucid.,0
Solution that works for me,0
slayer: It has been over a year with no solution for this bug.,0
This now works for me in Jaunty as of yesterday afternoon/evening.,0
doesn't work in edgy rc1.,0
OK it looks like the problem is fixed for me in both the stock 2.6.35 and +iofix provided by Brian Rogers. There's still [kdmflush] and a bunch of other programs causing a lot of I/O wait (according to top and iotop) but the system is MUCH more responsive. Usually when the problem occurred the HDD light would go solid for several moments before I could use my system again. Now the pause is brief much less than two seconds if it ceases being responsive at all. I mentioned earlier that the problem still occurred shortly after boot but that was the HDD light I was referring to not the perceived responsiveness of the system. So for me the solution is to upgrade to 2.6.35.,0
Because I have packages installed from a PPA I get an error and can't continue with the upgrade.,0
In all cases the broken I/O has been fixed by the mainline kernel install.,0
i tried to add another file and finish the session but that didn't work either.,0
Thanks for your bugreport fixed in my local branch and will be part of the next upload. Cheers Michael,0
That's a 2.6.35 kernel and Lucid has a 2.6.32 kernel by default. So you can't tell whether 2.6.35 or the patches I added on top of it solved the problem unless you also test the unpatched 2.6.35.,0
i have the same issue compiz dies if it's larger than 2048.,0
this is not an nvidia problem as the same happens to me with ati's fglrx 8-2 if i try to use aiglx.,0
well i believe you are right in the sense that if the folder to which you are downloading the video is currently open/visible the thumbnailer tries to update the thumbnail and go crazy.,0
I've installed the iofix+19.28 kernel for Lucid from Brian Rogers. So far it seems to work. When the machine is booting up it still seems to have the problem however. iotop (which now works appropriately) reports the [kdmflush] service as consuming 99.99% I/O when the system is unresponsive but I haven't noticed it in the past 24hrs or so (my uptime is less than 48hrs currently). I will continue to monitor and I'll post back with results.,0
yes seems to be really fixed. Thanks Michael for the patch and the upload.,0
oddly i can't confirm those observations.,0
I got this today too but for me it works after the panel gets restarted.,0
It's not a question of stablility WebKit would have to be in main for Epiphany to be able to built with it. WebKit is not a candidate for main yet and probably won't be until KDE start requiring it for KDE 4.1.,0
thanks milan with patch 01_null_strlen.patch solve the problem (ubuntu 7.10).,0
Thank you for your help but I still have the problem.,0
Thanks to Patrick for the package. I tested it under Hardy Heron with my Sony Vaio SZ4MN integrated webcam and can confirm it works very well.,0
However one other person says they've not been able to reproduce that. So I can't say with certainty whether that's the case.,0
Yorick I completely agree with you.,0
I'm trying right now Mandriva Spring 2007 and this is the same thing the SATA Controller doesn't find any harddrive,0
I have the same problem on a Dell Vostro 1700. I have compiled and installed alsa-driver 1.0.15rc1 from source. Then the sound works OK.,0
Thanks for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. Unfortunately we can't fix it because your description doesn't yet have enough information.,0
martin: your workaround works for me!,0
Applets should not be larger than the viewable area if there's an applet above it then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen),0
I have the same problem as Steve,0
i'm not using nv i use the nvidia driver but that is beside the point.,0
This recently became fixed for me.,0
Your information did not get attached to the bug report.,0
"Yes that's true -- the current graphing code which uses the graphical library \""Guppi\"" which is a dead project can only produce the on-screen diagrams *and* print these to postscript but it cannot export these diagrams into pictures that are embedded in a HTML-file.",0
not windows-specific -- i get a crash from following those steps under linux at least.,0
pm-suspend works fine for me with the generic ATI driver.,0
I do not have the specific hardware so this bug is not going to be resolved without some testing.,0
I am also getting this with hardy beta 1 (all updates applied as of march 26 2008) use the scroll wheel to increase the volume and the applet goes down in volume and the applet shows mute and other strange behavior,0
Hi all this happens also in ubuntu server 7.10. It's very annoyng.. in Debian Lenny this does not happen,0
Likewise i'm also experiencing this.,0
i was able to find the nls class but i didn ' t find the bundlefinder class,0
I'm having the same issue. Only just noticed today.,0
I'm not convinced this is a xubuntu bug.,0
Anyway I agree with you in that it sounds stupid that rebuilding the,0
so that isn't the problem with mine i think.,0
yes that's true the bug is still there but at least both packages are in the repos...,0
thi is not a solution.,0
It fixed the problem for me too.,0
Well not so easy since there are problems with wi-fi but since I'm using a live usb with some free space for changes,0
The cause of the problem is known and the Ubuntu guys will release a fix soon enough. This will probably either be rebuilding linux-ubuntu-modules with some new compile flags or with a complete kernel rebuild and some patches,0
"During the connection dialog however I get the same message ""Cannot get information from the serial port."" maybe because usb is not a ""regular"" serial port.",0
i agree with what mike said - we (it) do a lot of last minute work and would have been able to handle this one too.,0
I don't think they have xulrunner-1.9 in debian so lets wait for this and see what we get.,0
Problem seems to have been dissapeared. I tested on a clear 7.10.beta install and no problems anymore,0
Okay but your mockups are bad (I hope you do not take any offense because its a great idea!).,0
Yes this has been fixed for me as well since the final release.,0
That is a different bug and has already been reported.,0
"I get the same problem described by DanM for ""sleep"" and the same problem described in the original post for hibernation (screen flicks on an off).",0
No it doesn't make sense to me either when you put it that way.,0
i can confirm this.,0
I can confirm that the rootflags boot option doesn't work at least with locale=es_ES.utf8.,0
macobas' solution worked perfect for me! Thank you makobas.,0
All the patches (04 06 08) have been merged upstream and shipping with hardy. Note that 04 is not enabled in this diff.,0
I am facing the same issue with Hardy Heron on my HP laptop (Compaq nx6120).,0
Still no dice on my 1420. I tried seveal combinations in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base after installing linux-backports-modules. No sound of any kind.,0
ipw3945.ko works fine with 2.6.17-11 generic.,0
unfortunately we can't fix it because your description does not yet have enough information.,0
ok i can confirm that making the changes that you specified above does allow me to get sound,0
Suspend in Gutsy still hangs with the latest fglrx release,0
i agree with sergio zanchetta: there are many people having this problem.,0
thunderbird did not close while under gdb. but it did not open the email either.,0
i can also confirm the issue for hardy exactly the same as with gutsy.,0
It appears to still be a problem. I never saw a battery status from it.,0
Thanks for the response Stefan. I'll give this a try soon.,0
grub cannot see the usb keyboard there is no option in the bios for legacy keyboard or any other options for that matter.,0
I have the same problem i was going to buy a 4965AGN wifi card anyway so i will see if that fixes the problem.,0
I still won't consider this bug closed though..,0
Another useful datapoint is that the submitter of 197183 claims that this worked in Dapper.,0
I at least can't reproduce it with a simple checkout.,0
i think it would be reasonable to put the mdadm patch before this delay also.,0
2.6.26 kernel works so far. but I can't even boot the 2.6.27 kernel so,0
Yes your first example works as expected.,0
apt cannot check every single bit of the cache file for correctness this would defeat the purpose of the cache.,0
i have similar problems as martin above.,0
of course you are right that the reported address boundary error is fish-specific.,0
I can confirm the missing libwfb is the same bug as . Applying the fix described for the 9755 driver but using the 100-series libraries worked for me.,0
Thanks for the tip I updated it and now it works perfectly.,0
I can confirm that lizardmenke's workaround does in fact work.,0
This bug was fixed in the package xubuntu-default-settings,0
I confirm that jasbur's fix works for me.,0
Same version as above poster won't suspend for me neither on keyboard nor mouse activity.,0
uploaded to gutsy-proposed. Thanks for your contribution.,0
Ok I can reproduce this now.,0
Robert - while you are experiencing the same symptom as Steve unless you have the same hardware it would be best if you opened a separate bug report and include the same information we requested of him. Thanks in advance!,0
Working on a Dell Latitude 630 except that microphone capture is unacceptable Has anyone else tested microphone?,0
Tim right. There is the patch (unchanged 0.40 release i386 only).,0
I get this same problem,0
"I also report success with Hardy. No ""irqpoll"" needed anymore. Thx",0
Loading snd_hda_indel with model=ref makes it work again.,0
miked your run looks good the test suite passed.,0
mikael nilsson: hm interessting. it fixes the problem on my development and on my test-system.,0
i have had the same problem as neal and pinkwerks in booting from the fiesty live cd the xfce panel fails to launch.,0
i concur with the findings of philipp.,0
I have also such a problem NetworkManager taking 100% CPU all the time making it impossible to do CPU-intensive tasks like compiling.,0
Yes I have a laptop. And right it seems to be the same issue.,0
I confirm that I also run into this bug in my Hardy alpha5 installation and that Sven's workaround works great.,0
I confirm that the heindsight solution works for my laptop.,0
Having the same problems on a T42 I downloaded the 2.6.24-2 kernel as suggested and I was able to enter suspend mode and to resume.,0
Okay we've already tried this and got a '404 - Resource not found' error.,0
Thanks Travis we're looking at doing an update of the -ati driver for Gutsy.,0
I agree with Wodz but I'd go one step further and say the legacy driver should be the default.,0
i do agree that it can be confusing and i don ' t mind if we won ' t allow it,0
Ah now that is interesting. I'll ask our python-apt guru about this.,0
the above fix proposed by archdrone also works for the hp compaq 2510p (just change the c098 with c099).,0
same here and works for me too : ),0
As the description states 3.5.0 is out and SHOULD be tested in karmic to make it run great in the next LTS release. Ubuntu already is the distro of choice for most developers.,0
Marius: Wow good catch!,0
i confirm that in feisty fawnusing stock kernel.i have 2 wd hdds,0
same thing happened here.,0
OK I am testing on SantaRosa platform Thanks XIaoyang for the correction. thanks Kevin,0
I can confirm this works.,0
Good point I have released this clarification to HEAD.,0
Thanks! Finally this bug which I have been beating my breast about since Feisty days is getting attention.,0
I just promoted gnome-vfs-obexftp to main so please go ahead and add the dependency.,0
this is a beta blocker (at least),0
This bug is critical as Fabien said simply because it exists in the default setup and has a very high risk of data loss for unsuspecting users.,0
The patch applies cleanly for me. I've also asked on IRC and persia confirmed it too. Resubscribing u-u-s.,0
I agree it needs to be re-instated I'm just trying to find the best way to do that.,0
This bug was fixed in the package python-apt,0
This bug is easy to fix. Here's a patch that works for me,0
Indeed also conformation from my side removing the key with a did help.,0
And it would be great if you could attach it .,0
Hi I have the same problem with bash for ex in for loop bash,0
The fglrx hang should be fixed with the latest fglrx. glxgears are useful to verify its working,0
i agree with every one of those objections;,0
I didn't change any settings; it worked out of the box after installing the linux-backports-modules-generic package.,0
The temporary solution suggested by orgoj in comment 9 is working for me thanks! It was quite easy to install (althought my first impression of the website was different).,0
I don't think that adding number of job in the name of pdf is too problematic.,0
Possibly but may be the same underlying cause just that today's update exacerbated the problem.,0
dinhtrung's solution works better for me if i select the window by title.,0
but I'm not convinced that the corruption is caused by libc6 because corruption of other packages have occurred as well.,0
I am also having a similiar problem with Gutsy running the latest updated on a Thinkpad T60.,0
You are correct all these will be in the next issue of the Debian package so there is no need to do anything right now.,0
i can confirm that this is still the case in ubuntu 7.10 (gutsy gibbon).,0
I had the same problem on PowerPC and can confirm that Herbert V. Riedel's patch fixes it.,0
"Same here Gutsy with current updates and an HP Photosmart 8150 which worked before. Had the same ""job-stopped"" problem.",0
"Yes in my opinion they should look like ""user-home"" folder",0
The seven first comments indicate that this is a harmless warning and that things otherwise work well.,0
ben romer's suggestion worked for me.,0
Thank you very much Peter. Works like a charm.,0
I also have the no sound issue with my Lenovo 3000 n100 0768-a52.,0
I can confirm this works.,0
Thanks Leann. I have alpha 6 running from live cd for some hours now and have not encountered any mouse trouble. Thanks!,0
hi ricolai your solution worked great for a dell inspiron 1720.,0
"There is a workaround. The ""gnome-power-manager_2.20.0-0ubuntu6"" package is buggy.",0
i can now confirm that the problem is fixed in feisty.,0
Well done for your work Steve,0
i agree with duncan (and this bug/wishlist item).,0
Doesn't work for me either. I get the same blinking moon on my Thinkpad.,0
stephen thorne you are absolutely right.,0
Yes I confirm only the Epilicious extension prevents Ephy from closing on my machine.,0
This might fix it for you if your video is strange. As a workaround I'm happy enough with this until things improve. Cheers,0
For me the problem was solved after making a $ sudo apt-get update,0
Rebuilding alsa with module assistant and rebooting make sound with 2.6.22-13 on my Latitude D830 working.,0
Great video Andrea! The mute icon and balloon tip also shows up if you simply point to the volume applet and spin the mouse scroll wheel.,0
Thanks for the explanation.,0
"I'll add that the Lenovo 3000 V100 notebooks also have this chip. I too had to compile from SVN (with 2.6.22) to get wireless working on it. It would be nice to have this compiled into the Ubuntu kernels so it ""just works"" for most users.",0
i can confirm this problem.,0
Sven is right I meant that it would be usefull to have the swap option after the creation of the rectangle selection.,0
i do agree that it can be confusing and i don ' t mind if we won ' t allow it,0
And related to Bug 131133 too.,0
wm_eddie...I went back thru your info & yes that will work--I would suggest you take a look further at the file,0
This bug was fixed in the package network-manager,0
OK is this ok: Package: ubufox Architecture: all Depends: firefox apturl Description: Ubuntu Firefox specific configuration defaults and apt support Extension package for Firefox provides ubuntu specific configuration defaults as well as apt support for firefox plugins/extensions.,0
Looking at Christians write up in comment 58 it seems very much that the device is behaving correctly at the kernel level (lucid and up at least).,0
I have the same problem with my ATI card and non-proprietary drivers.,0
I believe I was bit by this bug using my Netgear MA401 PCMCIA card. I can confirm Mike's observation that the problem has disappeared since 2.6.22-14!,0
"I think that this \""common standard\"" should be as good as possible by default.",0
i couldn't agree more.,0
i sponsored michael's debdiff (thanks!) and accepted it into gutsy-proposed.,0
Confirmed working with Gutsy 64-bit on Latitude D630.,0
no that's normal you are not supposed to have one for ftp sftp smb etc,0
It would help us greatly if you could test with it so we can work on getting it fixed in the next release of Ubuntu.,0
i don't think targeting it for edgy-upgrades is the right thing to do and we did never had the need to run it twice before.,0
I think Tormod hit the nail on the head on that (but I don't know blkid internals too).,0
Then again gconf-editor reports this new key as having no schema,0
I checked fix for Hardy and it works. I also tried to revert your changes spe did not start. I tried both Feisty and Gutsy your fix solves this issue for both releases.,0
It is not fixed for me in Intrepid !,0
I am experiencing the same problem on gutsy.,0
This does not appear to be a bug report as such.,0
I fully agree with Dan as well.,0
it is not the same bug.,0
it also occures to me,0
Fixing this by Rosetta would have been impossible as there is no search.,0
I can confirm that.,0
the -nomodify change had no effect on my system as well.,0
the latest version in feisty does fix this issue.,0
I have more details in my report but it seems the issue is not specific to all udf discs Hardy Heron or even Ubuntu.,0
Same here with gutsy.,0
netcfg never emits an iface line without an auto line right above it.,0
thanks peter. i agree with you. i ll move the request to kdelibs even if i m against too.,0
the branch currently looks very weird. it looks like it got created off head. also i ' d rather not do that version increase dance.,0
I'm on this.,0
No this still affects 8.10.,0
I agree it needs to be re-instated I'm just trying to find the best way to do that.,0
i cannot revert the version change inside the head stream for org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core as one i-build occurred since the version has been changed,0
Agreed that is still on my list of intentions.,0
from my perspective i have absolutely no way to duplicate it...,0
seems to work fine now.,0
forgot to add one little thing...soo tired... i tried disabling gnome-at-visual (in session preferences {assistive technology/AT}) because the chart showed a strange 2 seconds of zombie time after login... but this did not do anything.,0
We have a similar problem,0
Hi I've not added the feisty-proposed stuff to sources.list and I'm getting the same error.,0
You'r right. I forgot the viewer,0
Hi motu-release We have a fix for this bug but Sebastian recommended we should pull in the new version as it has some important fixes.,0
Thanx a lot for your explanations Graeme! I can confirm this on our server,0
since lucid and karmic have the same linux-firmware package i don't think that this is fixed in lucid yet.,0
of a duplicate bug. Yes apparently it IS fixed !! WOOHOO!!!,0
Sitsofe please don't set bugs back to New when the reporter provides information. It should be moved to Confirmed if the information seems appropriate/complete or left at incomplete if you have asked for more information.,0
I feel your pain. This bug affects me just about every day.,0
I can confirm its still an issue for the default install of Kubuntu Jaunty,0
Update: ndiswrapper works fairly well with the latest Bootcamp Windows XP driver.,0
i am unable to ssh to machine when it is freezed.,0
Excellent idea!,0
Hi Jose Hrm unfortunately the files still do not have the needed piece of info,0
i confirm that this workaround works.,0
In response to rojanu I have neither fglrx or nvidia loaded,0
same as above described here with Gutsy as Beta now and the latest kernel from a couple of hours ago: 2.6.22-14-generic,0
n0PxN0p please do not mark this report a duplicate of another,0
The same here my laptop doesn't shutdown when the battery is critical.,0
"i have run the command ""sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg"" which was suggested in other thread but that didn't help.",0
Just a note the package hasn't actually been released by Debian (as implied by the previous misleading message). The RFP bug has only been closed because there were 18 months of inactivity.,0
Got this problem on an Ubuntu Server 8.04 recently. I don't have any Wireless network adapters so I just did this.,0
If the check for GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE doesn't fail for the radeon card in question (where it is supposed to fail) it will probably be necessary to write a tiny test program in C which tries to allocate a GL_PROXY_TEXTURE2D of the required size.,0
Apparently wxPython 2.8 doesn't work with spe any more.,0
Same problem with Inkscape and Listen - I compiled Inkscape from SVN Trunk ...same gslice error,0
Forgot to post kernel version,0
I've only suspended/resumed once after I installed the driver but I'm sure it worked as it should and I'm sure it didn't work before.,0
Hi Marco I tried that as it was mentioned in the fixes above but still no joy! It'll work if I turn desktop effects off but not when enabled.,0
keulieminogue : Thank your very much for your confirmation.,0
I still can't reproduce anymore here - maybe your mirror is behind or this issue is one that is very hardware/settings specific.,0
but that's really neglectible and I'm fine with your approach of counting any non-empty added line in the patch.,0
I have not tried the client-side solution like you have used so I can not comment on that.,0
jonathan thanks for the patch.,0
This doesn't seem to be fixed in hardy.,0
Same here - WEP-secured wireless working perfectly yesterday,0
I can not reproduce this here unfortunately (with open or closed terminal widget) could you please give some more details:,0
yeah pulling the checker entirely for windows ce would be fine (until such time that users can do something about it),0
i m sorry that i do not use kspread all that often so i can t pinpoint exactly when it stopped working for me,0
Michael: I have an i945/945GM which works fine on both -intel and -i810 drivers however both display the same XV problem with video glxgears etc.,0
Then I don't think SVN HEAD has the fix as found by Joe Barnett.,0
Gutsy Gibbon / Tribe 5. Macbook/Madwifi works after following these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook Just compile the module (trunk) and install it. No other steps were necessary.,0
This bug unfortunately did not receive much care lately. Sorry.,0
Dorian: Thanks this fixed it for me. Now got sound after suspend working.,0
Well killing the pulseaudio process has now fixed my sound problem a few times. I can't reproduce the problem at will though.,0
Sounds fine to me I guess...,0
all of which i've tried all of which didn't work for me.,0
I think this is more/less what Martin's script does.,0
The NLS class doesn't seem to provide me with the same functionality that Platform.getResourceString does so I am assuming that BundleFinder would do the job that I need.,0
I'm also getting the BusyBox error when I tried Kubuntu Gutsy Gibbon 7.10 Tribe 4 AMD64.,0
I installed the CoverSync plugin to latest exaile (Ubuntu Karmic 3.0.1) but it doesn't show up in the plugins listing in preferences.,0
Thanks for testing with a Cisco concetrator that supplies a default route.,0
There isn't really a good test case for lum I found this problem with linux-backports-modules which is far more likely to get removed and installed (and exhibit the problem).,0
no problem! this is the way it is supposed to work.,0
It's not a bug in the xrandr program but more likely in the driver.,0
Works fine with the latest version from upstream and the patch.,0
I still get: Traceback,0
Same problem here as Voltaire with Ubuntu 10.04 and Rhythmbox 0.12.8. I seems to be working fine now (but of course it won't look for new songs).,0
TJ There was no difference for me after applying your change.,0
performace is fine for me.,0
David: It may be a new bug but it certainly seems to be related to this one as the only systems affected by the kernel lockup are the ones that needed the wireless drivers.,0
Same here. The issue with the touchpad doesn't affect me.,0
I dont know if other programmes have problem with greek names.,0
I also have this problem on a Thinkpad T60.,0
Unfortunately CTRL+ALT+F2 does not work.,0
I can confirm this problem on Ubuntu Hardy. However the solution provided by Onno by adding local port 10000 solved it instantly.,0
i don't think this is a firefox issue but compiz related.,0
thanks for the tip chris i came to the exact same conclusion when looking at the code today. i just hope we will be able to stick to the jgit api and don t go back to using egit,0
i have rejected the firefox report since this does not seem to be isolated to firefox as robbbbb and leonard broman.,0
mlind : Thanks for your work! I think that it's great work like that.,0
this used to work fine on hardy until maybe a week ago. I've raised Bug 192217 as I can't tell whether it's for the same reason as in this bug,0
Daedalus Yes your testing and observations match with mine.,0
I compiled Banshee 1.2.1 today but still no luck.,0
Sound on the D830 be fixed by using a newer version of ALSA: make sure you have all requirements to build the kernel,0
Still having this same problem on a new Hardy beta install using 2 drives in a RAID-1 mirror.,0
I own a Lenovo 3000V100 which I have now upgraded to Gutsy and faced the same problem (while this was not a problem in the prev version).,0
Martin unfortunately users are always suggested to uncheck any third-party repositories before upgrading to a new release.,0
David Tombs: Yeah you're right I was thinking it was a symptom of the same problem.,0
waddayaknow previous comment was not entirely correct.,0
I need to confirm what Arthur Furlan told. I also had this problem of waiting a long long time before the quit window comes.,0
i'd say it doesn't make much sense to read xorg.conf.,0
Yep I did a clean install of 7.10. And it's still slow like,0
This bug shouldn't have priority 'low'.,0
i've just tried it out in feisty and it works!,0
hmm i can't repriduce this with gnome-terminal firefox or evolution.,0
daniel i agree with you that it should work the same for the user on all applications but i'm not sure who is responsible for making this sort of decision.,0
Xinerama is no longer available at all not because of a driver issue but because the whole X.org architecture changed in version 7.2.,0
Problem still exists exactly as described workaround does the job though.,0
Suspend and hibernate do NOT work with the backport module for me either (on D830) but as Julian says 1.0.15rc1 works perfectly. I will stick to compiling my own module as it seems.,0
arand Thanks for all of the data that helps a lot.,0
sometimes when I reboot X server copiz crashes. I dont think it ever crashes after a full restart.,0
Problem solved. Thank your for your quick response.,0
"Sorry for bringing this up again... I have to write down things that need to be done... I forgot to remove the ""draft"" status from ""sect1""...",0
Verified. This fix works for me as well using gutsy-alternate-i386.iso Tribe 2 release for installation in (k)qemu.,0
hi davur i think the white-screen issue is a different bug.,0
Me too same problem - I'm running Linux Mint OS and Evolution mail.,0
No need to keep flooding the maintainers with comments this bug has been confirmed and will be fixed soon as stated,0
Mark - thanks for the suggestion. This patch solves the above patch's problems.,0
Sorry about spamming this bug but I can't even turn off suspend/hibernate/shutdown from the battery preferences,0
i can confirm that ulfzart's solution (editing /etc/usplash.conf and doing update-initramfs) fixes it for me.,0
not available unsubscribing u-u-s.,0
In the interest of having this out quicker I'd like to highlight that JDT is very easy to install using P2 (Eclipse's new package manager.) So I think the only component that needs to be included in the .deb is the platform and the nice .xpm icon.,0
Bart I could not find libqopensync0 at http://packages.ubuntu.com/ (in any previous Ubuntu release).,0
Appears to be working with hardy final yes.,0
The kernel does detect the insertion but no device is associated with it the card is not mounted.,0
roland your suggestion solved the problem for me!,0
i can't get dmraid_0.9.9-1.0.0.rc13-0ubuntu1_i386.deb to function correctly.,0
Although this solution is good for Gutsy I think that for Hardy it'd be better to update the libfaad2 and libmp4v2 packages.,0
This is not a feature request this is a bug! The computer behaves in a totally unexpected way and a way that is not very useful.,0
After upgrade from Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10 I encountered the same problem - slow disk access it takes long for applications to start.,0
No as it was before on a clean install too. But it is gone for me.,0
The Inspiron 1420 is not affected. Sound is fine on mine (has been ok for a while).,0
when pressing ok again after some time passed by a conflict warning is shown. the conflict cannot be resolved by deciding for either (or both) dates,0
It fixed the problem for me too.,0
This bug affects my Lenovo x60 Tablet. Brightness does not work as to the scale either.,0
After some digging somehow this solves the problem,0
It's not available for Hardy (or anything prior to Intrepid rather) at this time.,0
I can confirm the advice from Roger thanks a lot!,0
This bug is still missing a complete dmesg and the output of lspci -vvnn,0
I agree with Krzysztof Kosiski this is not something that would make Ubuntu better but a bug.,0
of surprising sounds unpolished Well the name of this package is not open for discussion here. This is about package description.,0
Same problem on Gutsy and it's Jan 9th 2008,0
Not sure that it should matter whether you use persistent mode or not though.,0
Thanks for the dmesg output I will fix that ASAP.,0
I'm sometimes told my Latitude D830 has no battery in it which is clearly bogus. Never seen this with Feisty.,0
i have exactly the same problem on my msi vr610 new laptop with: ati technologies inc sb600 non-raid-5 sata 100% same situation as it was descripted above!,0
you shouldn t have to use the decorating classes directly just how they use treewalk s and dircacheentry s getrawmode to get the different statuses.,0
i agree with davegod75.,0
This is still happening for me too in (Kubuntu) Gutsy RC. Quite annoying.,0
Hi Justin I think that's a bit too simple. My annoyance is that when the setting is set to idle it doesn't go back to *where it was* but to some default value,0
perhaps your package mirror hasn't been synced yet and you run an older version of update-manager.,0
Well a broken package is very stable... :) Yes in this case the system is what is broken.,0
i can reproduce your issue however it's not the same as the one described in this bug report.,0
it looks good and i verified that it works for internal and external jars and that it doesn t break bug 297039,0
I really hate sidebars and would want to be able to disable them in place of these windows before I would migrate to Firefox.,0
Thanks Adrien. I assumed I could do that,0
I don't think this bug is SATA related.,0
i agree with mads's comment in regards to importance.,0
This fixes the problem but isn't quite correct...,0
i agree with ?skar in that this should have a higher priority - it's a real showstopper for some of us!,0
25 marius your bug is not related with this one.,0
I agree that this bug makes ubuntu look pretty bad for anyone who wants to type multiple languages.,0
you can enable it but you won't get starting sound at all.,0
As John Little also wrote my Amarok's setting is pointing to /dev/cdrom. I've got the same error both when starting from the KDE autoplay daemon or directly from Amarok.,0
I don't use evolution and so don't see the relation. Still update notifier dies several times a day of its own volition. I've killed all of the evolution processes just in case. Will keep an eye on it.,0
Conn: Yes EXA is just becoming really usable and I doubt there will be backports for gutsy since it might break other setups. So I'm marking this as fixed in Hardy.,0
rhythmbox shouldn't display shares it doesn't support.,0
I see the exact same problem on my Thinkpad T41p with ATI Mobility Fire GL T2.,0
$ sudo pppoeconf this option is not available.,0
Hi I've already got all this ready to upload...,0
that doesn't seem to make a difference.,0
That solved my problem.,0
this workaround does not work for me as i dont have the following file on my system: /etc/xdg/menus/debian-menu.menu on my system.,0
martin I do believe it is a showstopper as it also breaks Adobe's flash plugin inside konqueror/nspluginviewer.,0
Sorry guys lack of due diligence on this one (and it being past my bedtime). The single change was to avoid having to file an exception for a newer version,0
Yes agreed the pref is not ideal for this purpose.,0
I mean it's not here,0
Here's the same for wxwidgets2.8. This issue should be fixed next release 2.8.5.0 but in the mean time this should probably be applied for applications that use newer wxw.,0
this bug is not fixed it should be reopened and is in serious discussion upstream.,0
Same for me and this one is a fresh install.,0
There's no way to probe most CD drives without generating interrupts so there's nothing hal can do about this.,0
john's proposal in comment 2 is also acceptable.,0
Disabling acpi did nothing. Still always on AC according to this. Gutsy release out no fix not impressed.,0
I got the same issue.,0
sadly turning of acpi & hpet did not work.,0
the fix looks ok to me but i can t guarantee that there are no unwanted side effects,0
Oh and drag-and-drop never works for me.,0
i'm also running ubuntu 8.10 (intrepid ibex) on a hp pavilion dv5 (dv5-1075er) and seems i have exactly the same problem that guilhem lavaux does.,0
it's odd but the patch file itself doesn't have any indication inside it as to which projects the patch changes apply. this seems like an egit bug to me,0
If sound stops working after suspend-to-ram or suspend-to-disk try the workaround specified at . This works on Gutsy. Only thing about it is that upon resuming you may get a pop-up window about Volume Control quitting unexpectedly just click Reload and you're fine.,0
dincer but this is not what we want.,0
I experienced this too but in my case all the Evolution parts crashed and I also lost all my todos.,0
unfortunately we can't fix it because your description didn't include enough information.,0
i have the same problem in dapper drake (ubuntu 6.06).,0
i tried both use bash 3.1 and replace %q strings with %b and none of the workarounds solved the problem.,0
The issue also occurs with kernel 2.6.24.3 of today.,0
I installed Tribe 4 today. Still the same: the ACX files are there but the wireless does not show up in the network configurator.,0
same problem for me also...,0
it still doesn't work. i can't even get keycode using xev.,0
Fixes things here thanks a ton!,0
This of course won't work as lrm-video is part of the restricted modules package.,0
right. while i was looking at the code i became confused as well. i agree that we have to take a good look at it.,0
Ted Gould I tried out your package and when I move the brightness slider in gnome-power-preferences nothing happens. It seems like this is the problem,0
I saw your post on the ubuntu forums I installed SPE 0.8.2.a as per your instructions and it looks like it works for me.,0
I've installed 2.9.0-1ubuntu3 from Martin-??ric's PPA and I'm still having the same problem. Blinking cursor instead of X. I can't get into a terminal in the thin client to see any error messages either.,0
Martin - oops. What I meant was that the package in -proposed is the correct one e.g. it fixes the resolution issues.,0
I have a Microsoft Wireless 5000 mouse and this issue makes it nearly impossible to use the wheel fro scrolling.,0
I agree thanks again for your work on this Martin.,0
Sergey that looks like a different problem,0
Daedalus Yes your testing and observations match with mine.,0
I don't really understand this bug report,0
Hi same thing here. Let me summarize the problem and workarounds,0
We are not going to fix unix zoneinfo databases which currently return ('EST' 'EST') for eastern Australia thus making time.,0
were having the same problem on boot,0
however it doesn't seem terribly hardware accelerated.,0
I just want to add that I've got the exact same problem as Alan Pope.,0
dotty this cannot be fixed with python code.,0
i totally agree with unggnu that priority of this bug should be higher.,0
unfortunately we can't fix it because your description does not yet have enough information.,0
Tank you Thank you & thrice Thank you! You have fixed it & I can now use my Micro$oft trackball in Firefox as I want it to work,0
this bug is still not fixed.,0
performace is fine for me.,0
"Martin I see your point when you're saying that the \""common standard\"" should be as good as possible however I would rather not to filter any lines from a patch when parsing.",0
I have switched to KDE from Gnome because Gnome was taking too long to start up and this did fix the problem for me. So I think it is a problem related to Gnome.,0
Sorry the penultimate paragraph above is probably wrong since auth.log would normally exist at boot time with mode 640.,0
Leann correctly marked my bug (141339) as a duplicate of this one.,0
Just a quick update: Andres it is not the same just similar.,0
It would be great if you could test with the LiveCD for this new release and let us know your results.,0
I don't think there's a single fix which will fix both cases.,0
everything else seems to work ok.,0
There is no way to see the final line or two in the lyrics applet.,0
This bug is triggered for me too if I disable gnome-power-manager in my session. I have reproduced it with both Gutsy and alpha 5 of Hardy.,0
I cannot reproduce it on fresh install on the other box so it has to be some upgrade problem.,0
I'm using the T61 with Debian Etch Kernel 2.6.18-5-686 and I have the exact same problem.,0
not really. in the absence of a fix for 493276 content should reside on some other moco server.,0
> Andy Whitcroft Yes I have a Dimension 9200. Running Intrepid w/ all updates & have the latest BIOS Version: 2.5.3. I can shutdown but not restart.,0
Still not a duplicate of 140668 (see above). Please stop sending me irrelevant emails and please keep separate issues separate so they can be fixed.,0
I have same problem with a Dell Latitude D610 ( Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller),0
sorry - libglib not libg.,0
Hi there!! I was facing the same problem of you guys.,0
from what i know apt/synaptic/aptitude don't give an easy way to automatically downgrade something,0
I agree that the message in the properties form is a pain.,0
tried that but with the patch applied basket does not show up in the list of components even for a new user.,0
Experienced this problem while using Pidgin today.,0
i couldn't see an amd64 version to download or maybe i'm misinterpreting the versioning.,0
Sponsored and accepted into gutsy-proposed please test. Bryce this has been stalled for a long time.,0
Not working as expected under 2.6.22-14-generic,0
Tested lupin-support_0.16+locale113_all.deb. It works fine,0
I have the same problem with 2.6.22-11 on a D830. Under the latest version of 2.6.22-10 I could get everything to work if in installed the kernel version of the snd-hda-intel module instead of the one from the linux-ubuntu-module package. However in 2.6.22-11 the kernel version does not exist and so I can not get any sound to work in 2.6.22-11.,0
Mandriva One 2008 makes it work out of the box (at least in my case see my previous post).,0
The title position isn't correct also. It's much above the bar.,0
Confirmed as well. I use Hardy Final now had the Problem from the start because I upgraded from Gutsy and had the gnome-power-manager disabled before already.,0
it still does not work for me on an updated kubuntu edgy.,0
Yes agreed the pref is not ideal for this purpose.,0
2.6.30 doesn't work for me.,0
The proposed workaround solved the issue for me !,0
I can only assume that WebKit will be moving to main otherwise Ephy won't build now.,0
I also have the no sound issue with my Lenovo 3000 n100 0768-a52.,0
my windows partitions don't get desktop icons and the desktop theme looks rather old-fashioned.,0
i assume your workarounds are still viable,0
I've repartitioned/reformatted the card on feisty where it continues to work ok but on gutsy I still have I/O-errors on dmesg..,0
PS. The Patch from Matthijs works for me.,0
muzuiget's patch is similar to the previous patch in mechanism this will not work all the time.,0
I get the same error (I guess) as Tim using your package:,0
leonardo your bug has nothing to do with this one.,0
for me yes and since it ' s limited scope i would probably not even add a toolbar button but simply add it to the view menu.,0
I still have that crash in /var/crash. I'm reluctant to upload it though as it most likely has secrets,0
everything else seems to work ok.,0
Please do not re-file bugs. If the metacity devs wont fix it  the papercuts team cannot do it either,0
Yes I think it is similar bug.,0
no it doesn't work it only works on reboot but not on a new start...,0
I got the update this morning and can confirm it fixes the problem which I had reproduced just before.,0
I should note that I have root on lvm also but I don't have any further problems. I don't have any other filesystems mounted automatically though,0
elyk: Yes it broke it for me. I'm on a Dell Latitude D630. Annoying. :P,0
I've tested the package on Hardy Heron on my Vaio VGN-FZ11e and it doesn't work,0
Me too! Although: I did also delete the .update-manager* dirs from my home folder. At least it works!,0
also in this version i was never able to see an appointment (as red box was possible previously).,0
I'd like to confirm this issue on my system that my printer on Gutsy won't work even with the latest update. Also I'd like to confirm Sa?vann Carignan's workaround which got my printers working again.,0
shaun you have an intel so this bug is not really for you.,0
Joshua We are still working on some infrastructure changes for accommodating signing-keys for all PPAs. It should happen next week.,0
So only for me it is not fixed!,0
Actually I solved problem. My loopback network interface was misconfigured.,0
My rt73 chipset shows no noticeable improvement using the test v4.,0
I also have the same problem.,0
It looks like you are also counting empty lines which doesn't seem overly useful to me.,0
i tested the patch and it works as expected,0
Source package changed to -2.6.24 this probem repeats in Hardy again (and in -2.6.22 also wasn't fixed).,0
Ok done this sudo apt-get install build-essential and then the c compilation worked and then the audio works perfectly! Fantastic!,0
The recipe give by Daniel Moyne of just touching the file to the epoch does not work for me neither does the one from ysth. mvo's patch does fix it.,0
I also have the same problem.,0
It is no longer possible to do so since the whole window doesn't fit.,0
Hi Theodore Yes even after a reimage the issue still happens.,0
Also I do not see the relevance of the debbug 385181 to my original problem.,0
i think this would always be a good option.,0
This setting made no change in my case until I turned splash screen on and it worked. Turning the splash screen off again disabled the sound.,0
On my machine it won't resume from suspend to RAM with rc2 but rc1.,0
but i don't think that this is a fix.,0
we are now using this feature in gimp trunk. seems to work nicely with intltool 0.40.0. thanks again for this change,0
Even after trying out Tim Gardners resume script or Ben Collins' the sound doesn't come up after resuming.,0
again i think it ' s a brilliant idea martin,0
Sebastien - I looked through your attachment and did not find any sensitive,0
For a laugh and a half I decided to delete everything in Rhythmbox and rescan the music folder AND I can reproduce the problem again.,0
there should be no use to rewrite such a daemon.,0
as albert confirmed when visual effects are set to none the panel is normal.,0
it also shouldn ' t warn about nvidia ' s quicktime plugin which isn ' t really quicktime (it ' s actually just a shim to launch the media in an external player),0
I've figured out that removing package wireless-tools in Ubuntu Server Gutsy (x86_64) helps.,0
Sorry I could not reproduce this on Tiger either.,0
Rohan thanks for testing and the update. I'm glad to hear things are working for you with the Hardy Alpha release. I'm going to go ahead and close this report for now. Chris and fishor if you guys are still having issues with the latest Hardy kernel care to open a new bug report? Thanks!,0
it boots but after it switches to ncurses i don't have any text displayed.,0
Thanks Adrien. wxGlade is one of the wxwidgets2.8 applications which has a similar bug. Its UI freezes instead of crashing but backtrace output to terminal is similar.,0
problems related to usage of large i/o buffers) are not present.,0
i agree with artem baguinski.,0
I have a problem similar to chronographer. Interface wlan0 disappears when I install firestarter and reboot.,0
"The same here. I can connect using ""iwconfig mode ad-hoc"" but wicd can't.",0
however this problem has not been reported so far although bug 297039 has been in since 3.5.2,0
Same here 2.6.22-14-server DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu DISTRIB_RELEASE=7.10,0
The desktop icon is the official one and it is different from the icon inside thunderbird,0
Same here with a Lenovo 3000 N100 (0768-6EU). And I confirm what lusepuster said it works with kernel 2.6.20-15.,0
nvidia themselves aren't much help; i need to follow up with them.,0
i have also confirmed now that it occurs with either the gnome or kde desktop.,0
Albert you completely misunderstood this.,0
I can confirm that the fix is good i'm using it now without any problems (that i know of anyway ;P),0
sorry : i entirely disagree with your diagnosis,0
I am confirming this bug since another user reported the same problem,0
it didnt do any good.,0
Let me first say I am really impressed with gideon. It shows a lot of potential! I am really looking forward to the stable releases.,0
I cannot think why the behavior might depend on what is running on the terminal.,0
thanks it works for me as well...,0
this doesn't sound like it is the same problem that i'm seeing.,0
maybe you're right and we should move this to a different bug and start from scratch.,0
so it seems not related to the drive ( Asus Quietrack) I was not able to produce a backtrace. Kde bugtrace crashed too. Best regards David,0
comment on attachment 555658 thunderbird patch v1 this looks fine although there may be some ambiguity between whether we are just indexing messages really slowly or are working some other type of jobs,0
i thought that with the ubuntu 810 the problem came resolved instead not.,0
As reported by me and Jayhawk this bug has been fixed in the 8.04 release. So I think we could close this report.,0
de oliveira: you are seeing a different bug than this one.,0
I'm trying to package 2.20.2 which requires me to run autoreconf to update 99_autoreconf.patch. Any advice would be much appreciated.,0
not everything is ok as i expected.,0
I agree that Albert's idea makes sense.,0
this isn't an issue with networkmanager.,0
With the newer 2.6.24-1-generic kernel the problem has not changed. Thanks for looking into this Thomas.,0
Restored the original bug title since 'experiences' isn't a good name for something that needs to be fixed.,0
We've put some fixes in and they've not worked as well as we'd like so there's still some work to do.,0
Adding fbcon to initramfs modules had fixed it a while back but this no longer is the case. I no longer have any fb console and even worse gdm also repeatedly fails to start.,0
meanwhile i looked at david's patch and it looks sane safe and clean.,0
Oh! I am sorry! I was wrong. it is not available in intrepid!,0
i agree with slogger that this might be related with bug 22985.,0
i do not have a bios option to set the video memory on my dell latitude d505.,0
Also irqpoll is at best a workaround to help tracking things,0
Disregard that last comment it should have been rootflags=locale=da_DK.utf8 BUT it still doesn't help.,0
Well actually I still have the exact same problem,0
Hi Chris ok what i see is that network manager uses wpa_supplicant to setup network but never receives any association event back.,0
i completely agree with mat.,0
I did specifically say above that it's not a substitute for archive signing. It won't silence apt and it won't protect against all attacks.,0
the fix looks ok to me but i can t guarantee that there are no unwanted side effects,0
2.2.8 still doesn't have this needed feature... Frustration also confirmed.,0
I am getting the same error on xubuntu release candidate with all updates,0
forgot to add: this is on a Dell D830 and as expected this bug still exists in Gutsy final I upgraded to today,0
I use clearlooks theme and open office will work.,0
I never managed to figure out why my patch to libgksu worked and what was causing libgksu to lose stderr.,0
I have the same problem. No xchat icon. Clean 7.10 install. I'll let you know if it will change atfter a reboot.,0
This is NOT a bug.,0
I have the same problem since some month.,0
i already tried that in the past and it made no difference.,0
Thanks Alex built and tested your tree and it now works (associates correctly) with Network manager on an open network.,0
I try to enable the start splash screen and it kills the playing of question.wav file on login screen . It is a very annoying and weird bug. Anyway shutdown sound is not played too.,0
New debdiff many many thanks to pochu on ubuntu-bugsquad freenode for helping talk me through this...,0
the hosts removal of ipv6 lines solution does not work for me and several other people,0
Thanks for clearing that up! I'll be waiting to test things re: this bug when they become available.,0
"martin pitt re: hal 0.5.10+git20080301-1ubuntu2 it is not working on my lenovo t61p 14"" with an nvidia 128mb card nor is it working my lenovo z60m.",0
I am also able to confirm this on a Thinkpad T61 with the latest kernel and updates on Gutsy.,0
I don't think it was ever a good idea to install plugins disabled by default but it's also not a good idea to do something that will break in some situations.,0
I can confirm this. I have a nvidia card.,0
Unfortunately it doesn't resolve problem of logout sound. Splash screen absence remains the same.,0
Emmet pbuilder had no problems compiling wxwidgets2.8 with attached debdiff.,0
Your system lockup is caused by the 100.14.11 driver. It's horribly broken.,0
i do confirm this issue on acer travelmate 3210 partially solved stopping networking service.,0
sorry i wasn't completely correct in my previous comment.,0
you're right ... this bug depends of 362539 and not a dupe,0
i did not take it as such.,0
I tried it last week and it worked ok forme - wow thanks!,0
I don't think the D800 has even remotely the same sound hardware as the newest Dells.,0
libapt-front fixed this will fix itself in the next day or so.,0
it appears that 2.6.23.1 includes an earlier version of the same patch however this did not work for me.,0
i ran through my scenario and it seems to working ok i am certainly concern about the risk of regression as per comment 6,0
sorry that does not help for fsam7440 I just noticed it,0
I agree with others that you should be able to change it in the Mouse settings.,0
I have no idea why this is.,0
Yes your first example works as expected.,0
hi craig unfortunately there is no visible change in the behavior of the vpn configuration wizard with the new package.,0
I'm pretty happy with openSuSE 10.3 and Mandriva 2008.0 and tonight I will make up my mind on which shall remain in this laptop as I need the rest of the space to try another distro.,0
It seems my problem is different from Geoff's because mine is fixed by 2.6.23 and his is not.,0
"Ok the problem is resolv whith the ""sudo dpkg --configure -a"" Thanks for you help and i promise to whrite only in english for next time in this site.",0
jaakan: i don't think a reinstall would help.,0
i've seen variants of this problem on other machines and afaik it's been reported on amd64 too.,0
hello you wouldn't see any problem - you have a crt.,0
I agree with others that you should be able to change it in the Mouse settings.,0
You don't have to nominate it for the current development version.,0
Same Problem here with a up to date Ubuntu Gutsy (Sept. 3rd 2007).,0
After few tests nm crashes only when network is protected. On an open network still the same unable to connect.,0
Ted: Okay thanks for the clarification!,0
i always have had this problem. and i had to set it up manually because it never worked out of the box.,0
I had the same problem i have ubuntu karmic amd64.,0
(Gutsy up to date ~triibe-3) I had switched to a console and then back to X. The screen was not properly refreshed and seemed to hang.,0
cool thanks.,0
hm i can not reproduce this.,0
I confirm that this problem is fixed on my Dell Latitude D830 with Tribe-5 amd64 Thanks Martin,0
which makes the whole mechanism overblown and not as intuitive as I would like it to be.,0
Thanks for this additional information.,0
Hi Ketil thanks for the files but they don't actually contain any useful information for debugging the problem.,0
I'm trying hardy heron beta1 and I have this same problem.,0

"Oh. Important note - experienced on i386, so not an amd64 exclusive issue.",0
"This appears to be fixed with hardy heron, been running without compiz for the past few days, and the bug has not appeared again.",0
but i must say that i don't think these bugs should all be marked dups.,0
"Thanks proycon, Your suggestion seems to have worked for me. Everything looks like it worked and I'm running at full resolution. Thanks!",0
My dell Lattitude D610 sound worked in Gutsy and intailly worked in intreped but nolonger works with newest kernal,0
I think this is a better package,0
still happens on maverick. i noticed it happens much more often if cpu is busy and there is also big network traffic.,0

@sebastian kapfer i think that you misunderstood this bug.,0
"Martin and Luca, I finally had the time to set up a feisty machine. I checked and Luca you are right, I can confirm that this bug is obsolete for Feisty.",0
i couldn't figure out a more useful way to debug this.,0
the edgy live-cd works very well for me.,0
"Well, considering I wasn't able to describe how to reproduce the bug in the original report, and noting that the original report was almost five years ago, I could not possibly even begin to confirm the continued existence of the bug right now.",0
I'm on this.,0
"Synaptic and apt-get can't find linux-backports-modules-2.6.22-14-generic, even after enabling the backport repository... The bug is still present in Ubuntu 7.10 RC.",0

possible the new packege is not updated on all mirrors yet.,0
"Normally, all bugs on kernels must have some information described at: But because of the nature of the bug report, I am confirming without it.",0
I've installed it from the ppa (on jaunty) and restarted firefox but don't see the extension listed in the add-ons.,0
"Martin, Actually I have done some more testing and discovered that when index merging no physical reads were done (they are all cache hits) so ext3 problem is handling a ton of small writes",0
the ops crash seems to be not related with the rest of reports.,0
i'm having the same problem on a Hardy Heron fresh install,0
issue still seen on Gutsy Beta with Dell Dimension 3000 onboard audio card,0
"tried solution suggested by danielhollocher, it worked",0
After reading again and just have followed a forum link in Ubuntu Forums i saw i maybe have chosen the wrong bug to comment. Sorry !,0
I think I have found a fix for the issue of the garbage at the right/bottom when forcing compiz to start despite the failed texture size.,0
i don't have a focus problem in ubuntu 9.04 jaunty alpha 5.,0
I had the same problem described.,0
this log doesn't look like the latest.,0
I had the same problem with my T60.,0
I still can't change my screen resolution.,0
"@Jacob: -i810 and -intel have a different codebase, both need to get fixed and both work now. There is a bug in the intel driver though that makes video playback crash on older cards (i830, i915), but those cards work fine with the i810 driver.",0
unfortunately it had some bad side effects that caused breakage for people and had to back the patch out.,0
"the fix works for me, but since we are moving this to 3.7.1 i will hold off on my +1.",0
"However, when trying to compile the driver, as explained by ggepz, it fails with many errors.",0
I can just say that I have the same problem. The disabling of the exchange operations plugin does not help.,0
This is still broken in karmic.,0
"this patch is quite nice because it makes the markup more consistent and it allows someone to set the toolbar mode, possibly attach a palette, and so on..",0
"No, unfortunately the display-brightness problem still remains - at least I didn't manage to make it work.",0
"It is a definite improvement though, no question.",0
"It is compatible to the kernel, but it needs a newer python-launchpad-bugs in Feisty. Also, I am not terribly convinced that we need it in feisty, since we disabled the automatic crash notification by default.",0
the above attached patch solves this bug.,0
i'm sorry but i can't test this fix.,0
"comment on attachment 525331 new version with a working test i agree that changing the test should make the test pass, but it seems like window.close() being invoked inside a content window is still a thing that can happen and should also be tested",0
This problem is still very annoying to me on Lucid.,0
Solution that works for me,0
slayer: It has been over a year with no solution for this bug.,0
This now works for me in Jaunty as of yesterday afternoon/evening.,0
doesn't work in edgy rc1.,0
"OK, it looks like the problem is fixed for me in both the stock 2.6.35 and +iofix provided by Brian Rogers. There's still [kdmflush] and a bunch of other programs causing a lot of I/O wait (according to top and iotop), but the system is MUCH more responsive. Usually when the problem occurred, the HDD light would go solid for several moments before I could use my system again. Now, the pause is brief, much less than two seconds if it ceases being responsive at all. I mentioned earlier that the problem still occurred shortly after boot, but that was the HDD light I was referring to, not the perceived responsiveness of the system. So for me, the solution is to upgrade to 2.6.35.",0
Because I have packages installed from a PPA I get an error and can't continue with the upgrade.,0
"In all cases, the broken I/O has been fixed by the mainline kernel install.",0
"i tried to add another file and finish the session, but that didn't work either.",0
"Thanks for your bugreport, fixed in my local branch and will be part of the next upload. Cheers, Michael",0
"That's a 2.6.35 kernel, and Lucid has a 2.6.32 kernel by default. So you can't tell whether 2.6.35 or the patches I added on top of it solved the problem, unless you also test the unpatched 2.6.35.",0
"i have the same issue, compiz dies if it's larger than 2048.",0
this is not an nvidia problem as the same happens to me with ati's fglrx 8-2 if i try to use aiglx.,0
"well, i believe you are right in the sense that if the folder to which you are downloading the video is currently open/visible, the thumbnailer tries to update the thumbnail and go crazy.",0
"I've installed the iofix+19.28 kernel for Lucid from Brian Rogers. So far, it seems to work. When the machine is booting up, it still seems to have the problem, however. iotop (which now works appropriately) reports the [kdmflush] service as consuming 99.99% I/O when the system is unresponsive, but I haven't noticed it in the past 24hrs or so (my uptime is less than 48hrs currently). I will continue to monitor, and I'll post back with results.",0
"yes, seems to be really fixed. Thanks Michael for the patch and the upload.",0
"oddly, i can't confirm those observations.",0
"I got this today too, but for me it works after the panel gets restarted.",0
"It's not a question of stablility, WebKit would have to be in main for Epiphany to be able to built with it. WebKit is not a candidate for main yet, and probably won't be until KDE start requiring it for KDE 4.1.",0

"Thank you for your help, but I still have the problem.",0
Thanks to Patrick for the package. I tested it under Hardy Heron with my Sony Vaio SZ4MN integrated webcam and can confirm it works very well.,0
"However one other person says they've not been able to reproduce that. So, I can't say with certainty whether that's the case.",0
"Yorick, I completely agree with you.",0
"I'm trying right now Mandriva Spring 2007 and this is the same thing, the SATA Controller doesn't find any harddrive",0
I have the same problem on a Dell Vostro 1700. I have compiled and installed alsa-driver 1.0.15rc1 from source. Then the sound works OK.,0
"Thanks for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. Unfortunately we can't fix it, because your description doesn't yet have enough information.",0
martin: your workaround works for me!,0
"Applets should not be larger than the viewable area, if there's an applet above it, then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint, and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen)",0
I have the same problem as Steve,0
"i'm not using nv, i use the nvidia driver, but that is beside the point.",0
This recently became fixed for me.,0
Your information did not get attached to the bug report.,0
"Yes, that's true -- the current graphing code, which uses the graphical library \""Guppi\"" which is a dead project, can only produce the on-screen diagrams *and* print these to postscript, but it cannot export these diagrams into pictures that are embedded in a HTML-file.",0
"not windows-specific -- i get a crash from following those steps under linux, at least.",0
pm-suspend works fine for me with the generic ATI driver.,0
"I do not have the specific hardware, so this bug is not going to be resolved without some testing.",0
"I am also getting this with hardy beta 1 (all updates applied as of march 26 2008) use the scroll wheel to increase the volume and the applet goes down in volume and the applet shows mute, and other strange behavior",0

"Likewise, i'm also experiencing this.",0
i was able to find the nls class but i didn ' t find the bundlefinder class,0
I'm having the same issue. Only just noticed today.,0
I'm not convinced this is a xubuntu bug.,0
"Anyway, I agree with you in that it sounds stupid that rebuilding the",0
so that isn't the problem with mine i think.,0
yes that's true the bug is still there but at least both packages are in the repos...,0
thi is not a solution.,0
It fixed the problem for me too.,0
"Well not so easy since there are problems with wi-fi, but since I'm using a live usb with some free space for changes,",0
"The cause of the problem is known, and the Ubuntu guys will release a fix soon enough. This will probably either be rebuilding linux-ubuntu-modules with some new compile flags, or with a complete kernel rebuild and some patches",0
"During the connection dialog, however, I get the same message ""Cannot get information from the serial port."" maybe because usb is not a ""regular"" serial port.",0
i agree with what mike said - we (it) do a lot of last minute work and would have been able to handle this one too.,0
"I don't think they have xulrunner-1.9 in debian, so lets wait for this and see what we get.",0
Problem seems to have been dissapeared. I tested on a clear 7.10.beta install and no problems anymore,0
"Okay, but your mockups are bad (I hope you do not take any offense, because its a great idea!).",0
"Yes, this has been fixed for me as well since the final release.",0
That is a different bug and has already been reported.,0
"I get the same problem described by DanM for ""sleep"", and the same problem described in the original post for hibernation (screen flicks on an off).",0
No it doesn't make sense to me either when you put it that way.,0
i can confirm this.,0
"I can confirm that the rootflags boot option doesn't work, at least with locale=es_ES.utf8.",0
macobas' solution worked perfect for me! Thank you makobas.,0
"All the patches (04, 06, 08) have been merged upstream and shipping with hardy. Note that 04 is not enabled in this diff.",0
I am facing the same issue with Hardy Heron on my HP laptop (Compaq nx6120).,0
Still no dice on my 1420. I tried seveal combinations in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base after installing linux-backports-modules. No sound of any kind.,0
ipw3945.ko works fine with 2.6.17-11 generic.,0

"ok, i can confirm, that making the changes that you specified above does allow me to get sound",0

i agree with sergio zanchetta: there are many people having this problem.,0
thunderbird did not close while under gdb. but it did not open the email either.,0
"i can also confirm the issue for hardy, exactly the same as with gutsy.",0
It appears to still be a problem. I never saw a battery status from it.,0
Thanks for the response Stefan. I'll give this a try soon.,0
"grub cannot see the usb keyboard, there is no option in the bios for legacy keyboard or any other options for that matter.",0
"I have the same problem, i was going to buy a 4965AGN wifi card anyway so i will see if that fixes the problem.",0
I still won't consider this bug closed though..,0
Another useful datapoint is that the submitter of #197183 claims that this worked in Dapper.,0
I at least can't reproduce it with a simple checkout.,0
i think it would be reasonable to put the mdadm patch before this delay also.,0
2.6.26 kernel works so far. but I can't even boot the 2.6.27 kernel so,0
"Yes, your first example works as expected.",0
"apt cannot check every single bit of the cache file for correctness, this would defeat the purpose of the cache.",0
i have similar problems as martin above.,0
"of course, you are right that the reported address boundary error is fish-specific.",0
I can confirm the missing libwfb is the same bug as . Applying the fix described for the 9755 driver but using the 100-series libraries worked for me.,0
"Thanks for the tip, I updated it and now it works perfectly.",0
I can confirm that lizardmenke's workaround does in fact work.,0
This bug was fixed in the package xubuntu-default-settings,0
I confirm that jasbur's fix works for me.,0
"Same version as above poster, won't suspend for me neither on keyboard nor mouse activity.",0
uploaded to gutsy-proposed. Thanks for your contribution.,0
"Ok, I can reproduce this now.",0
Robert - while you are experiencing the same symptom as Steve unless you have the same hardware it would be best if you opened a separate bug report and include the same information we requested of him. Thanks in advance!,0

"Thanks Travis, we're looking at doing an update of the -ati driver for Gutsy.",0

i do agree that it can be confusing and i don ' t mind if we won ' t allow it,0
"Ah, now that is interesting. I'll ask our python-apt guru about this.",0
the above fix proposed by archdrone also works for the hp compaq 2510p (just change the c098 with c099).,0
same here and works for me too : ),0
As the description states 3.5.0 is out and SHOULD be tested in karmic to make it run great in the next LTS release. Ubuntu already is the distro of choice for most developers.,0

This bug was fixed in the package python-apt,0

"Indeed, also conformation from my side, removing the key with a did help.",0
And it would be great if you could attach it .,0
"Hi, I have the same problem with bash for ex in for loop bash",0
The fglrx hang should be fixed with the latest fglrx. glxgears are useful to verify its working,0

"The temporary solution suggested by orgoj in comment #9 is working for me, thanks! It was quite easy to install (althought my first impression of the website was different).",0
I don't think that adding number of job in the name of pdf is too problematic.,0
"Possibly, but may be the same underlying cause, just that today's update exacerbated the problem.",0
dinhtrung's solution works better for me if i select the window by title.,0
but I'm not convinced that the corruption is caused by libc6 because corruption of other packages have occurred as well.,0
I am also having a similiar problem with Gutsy running the latest updated on a Thinkpad T60.,0
"You are correct, all these will be in the next issue of the Debian package, so there is no need to do anything right now.",0
i can confirm that this is still the case in ubuntu 7.10 (gutsy gibbon).,0
I had the same problem on PowerPC and can confirm that Herbert V. Riedel's patch fixes it.,0
"Same here, Gutsy with current updates and an HP Photosmart 8150 which worked before. Had the same ""job-stopped"" problem.",0
"Yes, in my opinion they should look like ""user-home"" folder",0

Well done for your work Steve,0
i agree with duncan (and this bug/wishlist item).,0
Doesn't work for me either. I get the same blinking moon on my Thinkpad.,0

"Yes, I confirm only the Epilicious extension prevents Ephy from closing on my machine.",0

"I'll add that the Lenovo 3000 V100 notebooks also have this chip. I too had to compile from SVN (with 2.6.22) to get wireless working on it. It would be nice to have this compiled into the Ubuntu kernels so it ""just works"" for most users.",0
i can confirm this problem.,0
"Sven is right, I meant that it would be usefull to have the swap option after the creation of the rectangle selection.",0

"I have the same problem, with my ATI card and non-proprietary drivers.",0

"I think that this \""common standard\"" should be as good as possible by default.",0
i couldn't agree more.,0
i sponsored michael's debdiff (thanks!) and accepted it into gutsy-proposed.,0
Confirmed working with Gutsy 64-bit on Latitude D630.,0
"no, that's normal, you are not supposed to have one for ftp, sftp, smb, etc",0
It would help us greatly if you could test with it so we can work on getting it fixed in the next release of Ubuntu.,0
i don't think targeting it for edgy-upgrades is the right thing to do and we did never had the need to run it twice before.,0
I think Tormod hit the nail on the head on that (but I don't know blkid internals too).,0
Then again gconf-editor reports this new key as having no schema,0
"I checked fix for Hardy and it works. I also tried to revert your changes, spe did not start. I tried both Feisty and Gutsy, your fix solves this issue for both releases.",0
It is not fixed for me in Intrepid !,0
I am experiencing the same problem on gutsy.,0
This does not appear to be a bug report as such.,0
I fully agree with Dan as well.,0
it is not the same bug.,0
it also occures to me,0
Fixing this by Rosetta would have been impossible as there is no search.,0
I can confirm that.,0
the -nomodify change had no effect on my system as well.,0
the latest version in feisty does fix this issue.,0
"I have more details in my report, but it seems the issue is not specific to all udf discs, Hardy Heron or even Ubuntu.",0
Same here with gutsy.,0

"Agreed, that is still on my list of intentions.",0
from my perspective i have absolutely no way to duplicate it...,0
seems to work fine now.,0

Hi Marco I tried that as it was mentioned in the fixes above but still no joy! It'll work if I turn desktop effects off but not when enabled.,0
keulieminogue : Thank your very much for your confirmation.,0
I still can't reproduce anymore here - maybe your mirror is behind or this issue is one that is very hardware/settings specific.,0
but that's really neglectible and I'm fine with your approach of counting any non-empty added line in the patch.,0
"I have not tried the client-side solution like you have used, so I can not comment on that.",0

"@martin pitt re: hal 0.5.10+git20080301-1ubuntu2 it is not working on my lenovo t61p 14"" with an nvidia 128mb card nor is it working my lenovo z60m.",0
I am also able to confirm this on a Thinkpad T61 with the latest kernel and updates on Gutsy.,0
"I don't think it was ever a good idea to install plugins disabled by default, but it's also not a good idea to do something that will break in some situations.",0
I can confirm this. I have a nvidia card.,0
Unfortunately it doesn't resolve problem of logout sound. Splash screen absence remains the same.,0
"Emmet, pbuilder had no problems compiling wxwidgets2.8 with attached debdiff.",0
Your system lockup is caused by the 100.14.11 driver. It's horribly broken.,0
i do confirm this issue on acer travelmate 3210 partially solved stopping networking service.,0
sorry i wasn't completely correct in my previous comment.,0
you're right ... this bug depends of 362539 and not a dupe,0
i did not take it as such.,0
"I tried it last week and it worked ok forme - wow, thanks!",0
I don't think the D800 has even remotely the same sound hardware as the newest Dells.,0
"libapt-front fixed, this will fix itself in the next day or so.",0
"it appears that 2.6.23.1 includes an earlier version of the same patch, however this did not work for me.",0
"i ran through my scenario and it seems to working ok, i am certainly concern about the risk of regression as per comment# 6",0
"sorry, that does not help for fsam7440, I just noticed it",0
I agree with others that you should be able to change it in the Mouse settings.,0
I have no idea why this is.,0
"Yes, your first example works as expected.",0
"hi craig, unfortunately there is no visible change in the behavior of the vpn configuration wizard with the new package.",0
"I'm pretty happy with openSuSE 10.3 and Mandriva 2008.0, and tonight I will make up my mind on which shall remain in this laptop as I need the rest of the space to try another distro.",0
It seems my problem is different from Geoff's because mine is fixed by 2.6.23 and his is not.,0
"Ok the problem is resolv whith the ""sudo dpkg --configure -a"" Thanks for you help and i promise to whrite only in english for next time in this site.",0
@jaakan: i don't think a reinstall would help.,0
"i've seen variants of this problem on other machines, and afaik it's been reported on amd64 too.",0
"hello, you wouldn't see any problem - you have a crt.",0
I agree with others that you should be able to change it in the Mouse settings.,0
You don't have to nominate it for the current development version.,0
Same Problem here with a up to date Ubuntu Gutsy (Sept. 3rd 2007).,0
"After few tests, nm crashes only when network is protected. On an open network, still the same, unable to connect.",0
"Ted: Okay, thanks for the clarification!",0
"i always have had this problem. and i had to set it up manually, because it never worked out of the box.",0
"I had the same problem, i have ubuntu karmic amd64.",0
"(Gutsy up to date, ~triibe-3) I had switched to a console, and then back to X. The screen was not properly refreshed and seemed to hang.",0
"cool, thanks.",0
"hm, i can not reproduce this.",0
"I confirm, that this problem is fixed on my Dell Latitude D830 with Tribe-5 amd64 Thanks Martin",0
which makes the whole mechanism overblown and not as intuitive as I would like it to be.,0
Thanks for this additional information.,0
"Hi Ketil, thanks for the files but they don't actually contain any useful information for debugging the problem.",0
I'm trying hardy heron beta1 and I have this same problem.,0
"I don't follow how gnome-mount is responsible for the crashes, as I wasn't changing the devices attached to my machine.",0
dAniel hAhler's workaround fixed the problem,0
i tested it some more last night( pci=routeirq) and the mouse does freeze after a certain amount of time so this isn't really a solution.,0
"Thanks KhaaL. Juan Flynn suggested that I check the temperature to make sure no throttling is taking place. I'll give that a shot tonight. So far, the possibilities are some driver issue or some sort of hardware throttling issue. I ran hdparm -i /dev/sda on my work machine (which does not have this issue). I'll post the results from my laptop next.",0
it still shows incorrectly in rhythmbox.,0
"I have the same problem, since some month.",0
I tried to reproduce this issue but without success so far.,0
So I agree - in general we should only eject those devices which NEED ejection - ipods and the like - but those which can be happily unmounted - usb flash and hard drives to name a few - should NOT require eject...,0
"honestly, i don't believe we can fix it in feisty.",0
"I have a Dell Vostro 1500 which is in the same situation as most of the laptops here. Sound worked with Tribe 5 but 'apt-get dist-upgrade' broke it. I haven't finished downloading Beta yet. I have followed the instructions here for building alsa-driver-1.0.15rc3 using ""configure --with-cards=hda-intel,emu10k1"" and sound now works fine for me. I, like everyone else, would like this fixed before release.",0
this problem doesn't affect the default configuration.,0
No problem building wxwidgets2.8 with the patch in a pbuilder. I'm doing some testing currently and will probably upload it.,0
i dont think we should differ from gdm behavior here ...,0
"A possible better workaround is to use ""noapic"".",0
"I have tried that, but for me it does not seem to work.",0
hi everyone! i got the same problem here with my laptop.,0
i don't think the patch is correct.,0
I have same problem with stable Ubuntu 8.04 and Nikon D40.,0
ubuntu-minimal doesn't include python-* however.,0
"Hi, I kind of tested the 'Browse Device' feature, and it kind of works",0
still experienced the same issue unfortunately.... Josh,0
"Arthur, for me and other users apears its working well .",0
"No no, I mean it stays greyed out even AFTER it starts responding again.",0
It is working fine here without having to compile packages. 2.6.22-14 x86_64 Intel Corporation 82801H HD Audio Controller,0
"I have the evolution crash file that seems to be implicated here, but running root@hope# apport-cli -c _usr_bin_evolution.1000.crash does not reproduce the crash.",0
"Hi: I had the same problem with a HP 710c over LPT1, with sudo aa-complain cupsd it works again.",0
But this can't be adopted by JFace because they don't depend on the text editor plug-ins.,0
"Sven is right, I meant that it would be usefull to have the swap option after the creation of the rectangle selection.",0
"Unfortunately, one of the entries in the quirk table (i830_quirks.c) is incorrect",0
"I experienced this too, but in my case all the Evolution parts crashed and I also lost all my todos.",0
purging all scim packges does not fix the problem for me...,0
Now it's working,0
confirming that skencil just doesn't work as installed.,0
"I can confirm this! When I tried to switch from one to another I saw much faster throughput for a short period, then it would die off.",0
bug #124406 is more accurately describes the issue. This one is not correct. It is not the firefox or mozilla bug.,0
"The updated patch worked great - no more sigsegv's Thanks, Martin!",0
"Hi, I seem to have the same problem with Nikon D40x camera, but unlike D40 there doesn't seem to be any firmware fixes.",0
"Yes there is that bug, and follow last message by",0
I don't know how to do URL links. HTML doesn't seem to work,0
I confirm that jasbur's fix works for me.,0
this is not your bug.,0
I get the same Error - my Eclipse is crashing about 10 Times per Day.,0
"first, i am not convinced that the autoconf changes are necessary.",0
"I'm seeing this with keyboard shortcuts on Gutsy and Hardy as well. I worked around it for now by moving the keybindings from the ""special"" volume up",0
the sound still doesn't work.,0
I have got the same problem with my iPod 5.5G and Banshee from the standard repos.,0
"sorry it s not aboy xinerama 2007/9/13,",0
I'm also suffering from the same issue (slow hd i/o). I also run the SQLLite-tests.,0
Apparently Rhtythmbox in Hardy doesn't save information to it's TAG. This is annoying.,0
"The status ""Fix Released"" is correct, as it works in Hardy (or at least is what I've understood from the latest comments).",0
"I downloaded the latest beta of Hardy this morning and tried that, and unfortunately, sound does not work with that version either.",0
"i can now confirm that the patch from upstream solved the issue on jaunty, and that it's the only change required.",0
It clearly doesn't follow guidelines. At least not when it comes to respecting languages and culture.,0
The new linux-backports-modules package seems to solve the problem here on a Dell Latitude D830.,0
Bug 145360 and bug 191365 are duplicates of this. They each have 169 and 19 duplicates respectively. I don't seem to be able to mark them as duplicates without manually modifying all their own duplicates first.,0
"As eluded to, this appears to be a regression. Busybox mount -o bind works fine in Feisty.",0
"hi mlucius, the crash caused by dbus is not related to the original bug reported here.",0
"I think that this \""common standard\"" should be as good as possible by default.",0
"obviously not, but that ' s why i asked for review",0
"i agree the breadcrumbs-as-links meme is hampered by not being obvious, so maybe we should file a bug about that.",0
The command below corrupted my gconf and theme export,0
"I agree this is a problem, especially with a laptop mousepad, I'm going to try to find as a theme with thicker left, right and bottom edges in the meantime :-(",0
Downloaded Tribe 3 today. Updated Feisty with the alternate i386 cd. I still have the same problem: no wireless shows up at the network tool.,0
EricPadman's work around has also worked for me.,0
there is something wrong with this patch.,0
"It seems to be fixed, The package seems to have been updated as I now have 0.11.5 On Wed",0
"So, it looks like this isn't going to be fixed for Gutsy, huh. That's really discouraging. I have no sound on a Dell Inspiron 1300. Compiling the new Alsa stuff didn't do any good",0
"I agree, it is odd that none of the main ubuntu blog sites have picked up on this",0
@ aaargh486 - i tried your suggestion but the problem is still there.,0
"However, I agree that apport should just ignore these.",0
this is pretty annoying. the devs seem not really to care...,0
I'm confirming that this bug is currently fixed in hardy.,0
This is still broken in Jaunty.,0
"I've the same problem with my LG E500-U.AP49B, but the battery issue appears only when the battery charge level is ""low"", i.e. there's < 20 min remaining.",0
"I can confirm, any vga= settings in the boot params in menu.1st will black screen the consoles. The above fix didn't work uname -r 2.6.22-14-generic lspci 00:00.0 Host bridge:",0
Tested it in Russian. Looks better then in used to be.,0
no result. I didn't see any other output in lsmod that looked like a graphics driver.,0
"fwiw, in my PPA I have packages for Eclipse and a bunch of plugins that I built using the release binaries from Eclipse.org",0
"hi, I am not sure if what I have is related to this topic.",0
I have successfully worked around this problem by adding irqpoll to my kernel parameters,0
"there are a lot of useless forum posts about it, but no solution that i have found.",0
As a workaround I found that synaptic works.,0
"I tried to test my system with external monitor, but unfortunately I cannot switch off the internal display and xresprobe still reported lvds/lcd.",0
I have had the same problem as vonHalenbach.,0
i don't think that it does really matter if it's package foo or bar here..,0
"i'm with sergey on this, that is a feature we should have.",0
"however, i am using gnome and etienne solution wont work for me.",0
I've been getting this error as well.,0
"@ amnon82 uploading binaries here is usually a bad idea, it may result more broken systems than before.",0
i agree with arun that lowering the color depth to 16 is an unacceptable solution.,0
I most definitely do not see any WebKit package listed in Gutsy's repositories at the moment.,0
"Sebr - sounds good. I can commit it myself, hopefully, because I should have svn commit access soon enough.",0
"Samir, the disadvantage to removing the dosfstools package is that operations on FAT16/32 file systems will no longer be supported.",0
"this patch is quite nice because it makes the markup more consistent and it allows someone to set the toolbar mode, possibly attach a palette, and so on..",0
"No, as I said I am using a thinkpad X60s. Although g-p-m's log has lots of ""emitting button-pressed : brightness-up"" messages, I did not touch my computer to get it into this state.",0
After install from the packages: the mp3 preview works.,0
"I can't speak to others, but to reproduce my problem, I can guess it would be very easy",0
"happens also here (Jauny, kubuntu 9.04)",0
"I haven't had this in a while - i had it once a month or so ago, but not beyond that.",0
After reading the criticism here I want to say that plenty of us think you are doing a good job. Also look at https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/10061 for further help.,0
I'm not sure if this is causing the slow down. Definitely it does not make it faster.,0
I agree though that this bug is unacceptable :-),0
"even if it doesn ' t fix the general case, that bit of code is still wrong and should be fixed (_engines is an object and no array)",0
Sounds awesome Bryce! Good job anyone involved in these matters!,0
"it shouldn't be part of ""random"".",0
"I haven't experienced this problem for a while, either, whether compiz is turned on or off. I have to agree with Neil Woolford",0
"benjamin, are you working on this, as i don't see you as a member of any teams.",0
"#16 above works perfectly for Sony Vaio SZ670N , linux-headers-generic for it to work. Thanks!",0
i haven't seen this for some time now.,0
"Well, that didn't quite do the trick for me anymore",0
"As for my internet connection, this is unlikely to be an issue, both due to the error message of Audacious and the fact that I can play the streams in Rhytmbox with no problems. It's not a timeout, the error message pops up when trying to play the streams, as described in this bug, stating that either the codecs aren't present or they are not correctly set up",0
i have same bug in my feisty.,0
"i don't think there is any problem with it, people reviewing the proposed upload might be busy or mail is not the preferred way.",0
That sounds good. I signed for an account and I'll do as you suggest.,0
"It seems that Amarok2 does not always do ""encoding guessing"" job very well, either.",0
"Hi Milo, I've taken a look at your article and it's looking good so far. Thanks for all of your work!",0
I don't think that replacement functionality was ever implemented.,0
"Rohan, thanks for testing and the update. I'm glad to hear things are working for you with the Hardy Alpha release. I'm going to go ahead and close this report for now. Chris and fishor, if you guys are still having issues with the latest Hardy kernel care to open a new bug report? Thanks!",0
"Rhythmbox has rejected my patch and will not do anything about the bug, unless someone comes up with a more sophisticated solution. In other words, this will probably never be fixed. Sorry!",0
"Hi Thorsten, thanks for the update! Just wanted to assure you that your efforts are much appreciated. Cheers",0
"Problem not noticed here for quite a while, using 8.10 (Intrepid), compiz and Firefox 3.05. So as far as I'm concerned the bug is no longer present.",0
same here bit with upgrade of deluge from 0.5.2 to 0.5.4,0
"I do confirm that with kernel 2.6.22-14-generic of today's update, the sound doesn't work anymore. This method no longer works with new kernel 2.6.22-14-generic.",0

"Leann, I just retried ekiga with V4L (& V4L2) and I can't get the webcam to work....",0
"Let me add that I was bitten by this bug as well. I installed using Gutsy beta i386 alternative CD on a desktop computer, the gnome power manager is not started in System",0
i don't think we should be patching anything when that patch is wrong and results in user confusion.,0
I vote for marking this bug as duplicate of that one.,0
"I did not wanted to close the bug, I was quite surprised when I receive the following mail",0
I don't think that adding number of job in the name of pdf is too problematic.,0

comment on attachment 391515 fix bad craziness..looks fine.,0
Did today's kernel update break sound for anyone else? After installing it for me the module-assistant fix no longer works (Vostro 1500 STAC9205),0
"and after installed your last patch, lupin-support_0.17_all.deb, it is looks working well and all file can be display and visit now. thanks a lot.",0
Using ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) I also noticed Java programs would bog down the system.,0
lizardmenke's workaround fixed the problem.,0

"In version 1.5.6, Evan uploaded a workaround which should do for tribe-3. Moving over to tribe-4.",0
seems to me that it is not the same issue.,0
i also think the quote source should be on the left side.,0
I followed the directions listed in the IRQ debugging page above. None of the kernel options listed made any difference with the performance issue.,0

"No, you're not missing anything, it's just that the Rosetta is updated manually, so subscribing Launchpad Translations now.",0
I'm in the exact same boat as you craig.,0
The description still doesn't describe what ubufox does.,0
?ukasz Semler's solution in comment #29 worked for me,0
Sometimes resuming from suspend-to-ram works. Other times it doesn't work. So I can't rely on suspend-to-ram. When resuming from suspend-to-ram doesn't work,0
"Good point... Pictures are different of Photos (or Images). Maybe, the right thing to do is to make two different folders, one for Graphics, and another for Photographs",0

"Indeed, it is only for testing purposes. The back and forward buttons don't work, extensions and plugins don't work (I'll look into extensions), and scrolling is a bit odd.",0
"matt, i agree that update-manager is the preferred method for upgrading, but a lot of people have had issues with this.",0
"Not a showstopper for Tribe 4, since this seems to be quite hardware specific, and waiting for answer from Marc. Moving.",0
i did edgy upgrade yesterday and run into the same problem with my /home partition.,0
i more or less believe the hardy user argument is fallacious.,0
I think I may have this same bug with Intrepid Ibex.,0
That was a rhetorical question. Answer: No. We are discussing Ekiga here which is a totally different product,0
"thanks for the screenshots. you were right, the labels are appearing strange",0
"no, this has not been fixed",0
Posted on kernel bug tracker : http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8944 Thanks for your support.,0

"Compiz Fusion is just some addons for compiz, that question doesn't make sense.",0
I like the CTRL-B and CTRL-H features of Mozilla and would like that carried over.,0
I use metacity and this happens to me too so I don't think the cause is compiz.,0
"Many thanks, seems good but I would like to have Tonio's opinion too.",0
for this reason i disagree with the rejection of this bug report by the grub maintainer!,0
"Yes, it works but i've two images on a green background",0
actually this isnt fixed for hardy because there is no dom0 kernel for hardy yet.,0
"Hi Leann, I tested it on an actual installation. About 1/3 of the times I try, it doesn't crash during startup. This computer has a dual boot with windows XP now. XP and windows 2000 work properly. I did the install using the alternate cd. Thanks for looking,",0
Till now no one managed to get sound running with the default ubuntu gutsy kernel 2.6.22,0
i agree with roger that this is currently one of the most irritating minor issues with ubuntu and gnome.,0
"Thanks for trying, but I don't think it's that.",0
"Ah, Indeed thanks for the info. Just wanted to see how it looked and was disappointed with that error, but it works now thank you",0
"Hello, I have this problem since 2 weeks. The Gnome startup is very slow, its seems not responding several seconds. I use ubuntu gnome on my laptop since 2 years, and I didn't have a problem like this. It's not due to profile switcher, deskbar or compiz because I already used it before.",0
I've just read the article and it looks great!,0
Vanilla eclipse (3.3 version) doesn't crash here. It wont work with the default VM,0
"I can confirm this problem, allthough i do not use an SMP system.",0
i really don t think that the apply button had an icon on it....i will talk to tackat about this one,0
That worked for me. This seems to be new functionality.,0
"I can not reproduce this behaviour here, but it looks like a serious regression so I would like to nail it down for tribe-6.",0
I have the same problem.,0
i m guessing i ll have to install thunderbird along with the gmail-conversation-view extension,0
I installed ATI's latest version of their proprietary driver and this fixed the suspend/resume-bug on my Z60m with and ATI X600 and Gutsy Gibbon.,0
"apparently, it wasn't installed.",0
Thanks for reporting and providing debugging info. Milestoning for beta since this seems like a relatively easy fix.,0
"There is no card* in my /proc/asound/ folder (stock Ubuntu packages, no custom ALSA).",0
You're right. It seems to work when you're not using the bash-completion package.,0
"dunno, I don't have a multiscreen configuration to try that on",0
same bug on dell xps m1330 with gutsy updated daily.,0
It doesn't seem to correct my problems (using wireless-dev kernel and bcm43xx).,0
"Likewise, i'm also experiencing this.",0
Rockwalrus' comment about not being to update plugins using the package manager is incorrect,0
I am also having a similiar problem with Gutsy running the latest updated on a Thinkpad T60.,0
fix did not work for me (both patching compiz manually and downloading mario's debs).,0
everything seems to work fine.,0
So I couldn't use the USB mouse because it moved too jerkily. I also couldn't test desktop responsiveness while copying large files to an USB drive.,0
"Based on Jiahua Huang's work, here is the patch I've verified to be in good shape and can be applied to latest bzr trunk.",0
This doesn't seem to be related to compiz but I'm not sure what to assign it to.,0
for me also the problem appeared when turning on AHCI.,0
We don't need any of the patches for natty.,0
i confirmed that the workaround fb=false as suggested by wolfchri works.,0
"I am sorry Bryce, but this IBM mouse in question does not use the synaptics device drivers. This will not be much of help",0

"Me too same problem - I'm running Linux Mint OS, and Evolution mail.",0

looks good to me too.,0
"I never saw the problem with Edgy, and although I only ever ran Feisty on this PC for a day before changing to Gutsy, I never saw the problem there either.",0
"Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. It seems that this is the way deskbar-applet is working now, the popup has been removed from the code, so you're not gonna get it from newer releases i'm afraid, anyways, you can always open a report in http://bugzilla.gnome.org under the deskbar-applet product, thanks in advance.",0
Crash after livecd boot.,0
I found a (temporary) solution,0
"Bajusz, it sounds like there's still a leak at least in preferences view.",0
i also got this crash today when i was installing some updates. fortunately i got nothing lost,0
i don t think so...not all of the buttons have icons on them,0
i confirm that this problem still exists in current jaunty.,0
"i can't get dhcp or static ip working, but i haven't tried andy's suggestion above.",0
"Yes, rmmod'ing snd-hda-intel before shutdown fixes poweroff.",0
i don't think it is that hard.,0
"so maybe the fix for those will also fix this one. also gives hope that even if this doesn't make it into gutsy final we'll get a fix whenever alsa releases, which should be soon as they're already at rc3",0
"@John Vivirito, TZ and Kecsap are on the right track. This bug is not about typos. This bug is about the substance of the description.",0
excellent idea. having the line counter right in the apply patch wizard would finally give us a standard way of counting lines that everybody could use easily,0
Taking the acpi_sleep parameter out of the kernel line on boot also did not help.,0
i have the same problem as etienne and sebastian,0
I have tried different schedulers and made no difference.,0
"Yes, that would make sense for udev or anything else that enumerates through devices and partitions.",0

"@Rockwalrus: thanks for the insight! So, suppose the .deb only includes the minimum necessary to install plug-ins (I think that would be the platform install; a bit more than RCP).",0

I also downloaded the version off of Mozilla's main site and it has the same problem.,0
i was unable to find a xen version of the linux-image-2.6.27- tree in hardy or intrepid.,0
I think Tormod hit the nail on the head on that (but I don't know blkid internals too).,0
"no, some change from 2.6.20-12 to 2.6.20-12 broke everything, so now basically no tifm cardreader works.",0
I am also having the same problem. Adding myself to the voice group and downloading the latest version from the PPA did not resolve the problem.,0
"I am not able to reproduce this in Jaunty, marking Low, Incomplete.",0
"thanks for the tip chris, i came to the exact same conclusion when looking at the code today. i just hope we will be able to stick to the jgit api and don t go back to using egit",0

The Sponsors team should never be assigned bugs.,0
It would be helpful if everyone could test the latest Hardy Alpha release . You should be able to then test the new kernel via the LiveCD.,0
It doesn't work anyway.,0
I had the same problem with my T60.,0
i can't use my wireless etherner intel.,0
"Rusivi2, see this bug for your problem It helped me solve the same problem you have.",0
I don't see much point in being able to flip the aspect *after* the creation of the rectangle.,0
I had the same problem here (Gutsy tribe 5 with al the latest updates).,0
"I'm dropping the 8.04.1 milestone, which I don't believe to be a realistic goal at this juncture, but an SRU for this issue still looks reasonable to me.",0
Thanks dRewsus! Your workaround has worked for me too.,0
"the nls class doesn ' t seem to provide me with the same functionality that platform.getresourcestring does, so i am assuming that bundlefinder would do the job that i need",0
i had the same problem as described here.,0
unfortunately this fix didn't do it.,0
"yes, though i could also live without that button. i doubt people are going to toggle this frequently.",0
"hi, no, it is not an issue in oneiric.",0
Same happens to me on Ubuntu Karmic alpha 6 (64bit) with Firefox 3.5 and flash 10.0.32.18,0
"No I haven't tried the amd64 yet, just the i386. I know I can run 64bit, but I'm still not using it for now as it doesn't seem to have as good support",0
I guess /etc/defaults is also a good place for a variable to source.,0
"Still getting the same problem. This time however, there is no cursor like there was before and on my laptop the keyboard does not work. All i can do is turn off then back on.",0
yes this is exactly the same problem I have had.,0
Changing to the deadline scheduler appears to alleviate this bug for the most part.,0
I concur with Pekka.,0
"Guys, I don't see what the problem is.",0
You are right on both counts.,0
Strange. I made the change suggested by Rubin setting the IRQs to Auto. This morning I'm running on mains and the problem doesn't now occur.,0
"Again, I think it's a brilliant idea Martin.",0
"I am NOT affected by this bug. No matter how much blender or k3b rendering I do, I am not able to get it to lockup, I was however affected when running Gutsy. Also does not lockup even when running compiz blender and k3b all at the same time.",0

I've just found something odd,0
I have just tested it and it works fine. Thank you.,0
And I don't have unclutter running or even installed (Ubuntu 64 9.10),0
Hello! Same problem with Ubuntu Gutsy Tribe 5 with firefox and thunderbird,0
I didn't use nvidia and I have this problem.,0
I've been having the same issue since Feisty.,0
"Sorry Alex, I'm getting that script failing in several way, lots of syntax trouble.",0
I have exactly same trouble on a nVidia card,0
it seems that my problem and the problem of xandl12 are not related.,0
"Sepang audio works using Realtek's latest drivers, including record. We would prefer a backport, and are looking to find the module which we need to investigate by process of elimination.",0
not the only one - I've got this too,0
"I had feisty installed on my HP Pavillion Laptop, and migrated to Gutsy, everything worked o.k",0
It seems to be fixed. I didnt realize the package had been updated.,0
I have the same problem in Ubuntu 9.04 using evolution 2.26.1.,0
Ditto: no sound on D830 with Kubuntu Gutsy Tribe 5 i386. There was one little change over this week end,0
Same here - and no bluetooth devices!,0
"It 's not a really new issue, it started more than one week ago but I forgot to report it",0
"Looks like this bug has been fixed in Hardy and involves Gutsy only. The attached debdiff (based on Milan's patch) fixes this issue. Built, installed and tested.",0
Steve - Its unlikely unless it gets fixed upstream with ALSA 1.17 which eventually get backported to Hardy LBM.,0
confirm: steve's workaround works for me in gutsy.,0
psypher: Turning off swap definitely doesn't help for me as I've tried it with or without swap.,0
"On my Latitude D630 Sound is working too. The nonlinear volume Control appears here too, but this is an other issue. I think.",0
Sorry to have further muddied the waters. I would suggest using this issue to deal with problems specifically related to this IDE controller. I again apologize for adding to the confusion with my previous post.,0
I just tested with the daily live CD (version 2008-03-19). I was able to duplicate the problem.,0
I can't check this problem anymore because the computer that was mentioned in the original post was thrown away a long time ago.,0
"Sounds fine to me, I guess...",0
"As mentioned in the upstream bug report, the sound problem is intermittent. Mostly, it doesn't work. But even when I do get sound, I cannot capture and get the same message mentioned by Burt.",0
Adam: I can confirm the behaviour you describe with kernels before May (e.g. 2.6.22). The problem seems to have been fixed in later 2.6.26 kernels.,0
"this is just imho, but personally i don't see much value in a ""resize"" (or hdv) button.",0
I can confirm this problem on Asus eee 1000H. It is detected as Logitech wheelmouse.,0

"Oliver is perfectly right about the gdm, due to my present problems with using ldm I am very much up to date on how to setup gdm 8-) Best, r.r.",0
it does not seem like there will be a fix in feisty ...,0
The same happened to me. I am running Gutsy with the latest updates.,0
"dotty, this cannot be fixed with python code.",0
"Yes, the patch works.",0
"sorry, but i disagree with that solution. the underlying problem is described in https://issues.kolab.org/issue3801 and https://issues.kolab.org/issue2869, this is a bug in the kolab server, it s not reporting an error when logging in without the domain name and instead just lists no folders",0
i'm glad to say that the issue appears fixed for me too in hardy today.,0
"Sorry, I could not see the relevance, as I understand.",0
"I agree that it is convenient to be able to set a default value from the place it is used (e.g., the Image->Scale dialog) instead of having to open the Preferences and find the corresponding option.",0
Didn't get the result I expected,0
"Bryce, yes that sounds reasonable, although the data is only from one single user.",0
so I don't think it's Ubuntu-specific.,0
I don't have the problem with a recent kernel any more. It works for me.,0
i had tried xfce awhile back under gdm and that did not work.,0
"I have this same problem, I've just tested using Ubuntu 8.10 beta, It happens the same problem using 8.04, but there is no problem with 7.10.",0
"however, it is not obvious to me that these patches will fix the bug you have attached them to (which is almost certainly fixed in gutsy anyway).",0
I'm having this issue as well (Ubuntu 9.04 64-bit).,0
Bug is still present in Nautilus version 1:2.20.0-0ubuntu7 but is now intermittent.,0
"Hi, I can confirm that MSI M662 has the same touchpad and has the exactly same behavior listed above.",0
impossible to do it again because i cannot connect to the net.,0

"however, it is not portable at all.",0
"Happens here too on a brand new T61 with irq 23, pretty much same backtrace, with latest kernel from gutsy.",0
"looks like your patch never made it into udev, mdz.",0
"i guess you ' re right martin, but this will make the patch a little bit more complicated as the current patching mechanism is not very helpful in counting added/removed lines",0
it seems gnome 2.18 won't include this patches.,0
@Miika-Petteri Matikainen: Patch3 works beautifully for me! Corrects the issues I had originally.,0
Actually I would like not to add yet another entry in intl.css but to fix it in aboutMozilla.xhtml.,0
"i second mike's description of the problem, above.",0
i don't think gnome was configured to use pulseaudio as far as i didn't configure anything.,0
roma's solution worked for me!,0
"The same casper-rw file system corruption happens here in the Lucid 10.04.2. I was first tricked to believe there were bad blocks, then realized I was wrong after more test and Google to this thread. I know Steve's patch is not for the Lucid but I still tried, hoping it will work.",0
seems to work fine now.,0
both ekiga 3.2.5 and ekiga-snapshot give me this error on Karmic. I cannot use my sip programs even if I stop the moblock,0

"In my case, Master doesn't do a thing, but PCM instead changes volume just fine.",0
Can confirm that setting wireless rate to 5.5M works wonders. Getting consistent 450 KB/s transfer rates now and seems stable.,0
to me it's not really an option.,0
"i guess you ' re right martin, but this will make the patch a little bit more complicated as the current patching mechanism is not very helpful in counting added/removed lines",0
I think they just made the scrolling a bit faster but they didn't make a way for us to set the scroll speed. So the upstream bug wasn't really the same as the downstream one.,0
"I unchecked the ""use time"" box in gconf, and it's working fine.",0
Smashing my head against this right now. I see that those Jaunty packages depend on newer versions of libc and stuff. I'm currently running Intrepid but this is a production box and I don't really want to use a development version.,0
I solved my problem,0
but keeping backups of kernels all the time isn't a nice solution either.,0
"I agree that it is convenient to be able to set a default value from the place it is used (e.g., the Image->Scale dialog) instead of having to open the Preferences and find the corresponding option.",0

"KamleshUbuntu, thanks for the update. This sounds promising for you.",0
"no, i do not use a virtual private network.",0
Mario Carrion's comment was an insipration. I took a guess and added this to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base options snd-hda-intel model=thinkpad-t61p at the very end of the file.,0

the file is working fine for me...,0

"i just tried removing active-updates.xml and that didn ' t seem to help. in fact, i can ' t seem to find the .mar file from the second update cycle anywhere on my hdd.",0
The proposed workaround solved the issue for me !,0

"status confirmed i agree, the least we should do is give a proper error.",0
"It may not be related, but we were having speed issues with tracker in some computers here",0
Alex claims this to be fixed in gutsy.,0
kdesu version 1.1-0ubuntu2.2 doesn't fix it.,0
In my system I had the same problem.,0
I have just noticed this bug marked won't fix and wishlist.,0
i can confirm that the package posted by pavel rojtberg fixed this problem for me.,0
"It was fixed a while ago for most camera's (see earlier in this bug report), but the D40x is still broken",0

"Yes, I did, and it seems to work as a workaround",0
"i don't think i loged in and out, as i'm the only one using this machine, and don't usually log out, but i've seen this abnormal behaviour several times.",0
"Confirming Vitor Lamas Gatti's comment; it works great on 7.04, but crashes on 7.10.",0
"anyway, this is not something to be fixed, but rather a change that needs to be discussed with people like e.g. leinir.",0
i have tried it with a nvidia raid controller and it works!,0
"Thanks for your bugreport. I can not reproduce this behaviour here, If I use 0.59.23 I get the upgrade button.",0
"i have exactly the same problem, but not only in ubuntu, but also with the gparted-livecd 0.3.7-5.",0
tried to boot on different machines and different cd drives with no success.,0
"I had the same problem, i have ubuntu karmic amd64.",0
I'm still seeing the issue with my machine updated to hardy and using linux-image-2.6.24-11-generic. On boot I get dropped to a busybox shell because the hdd/controller cannot be initialized.,0
"Yes. The intention here is to respond to events instead of having absolute values like the previous design. So that unplugging is an event that is responded to, and so is plugging in or going idle.",0
"i don't think ntpd can help me here, as it is designed to correct small time drifts, update daylight savings etc.",0
Actually I am having the same problem too,0
"Sorry, it's been available since 1.2.3, but it hasn't been included in any Ubuntu package.",0
I've been having the same issue since Feisty.,0
I'm still running ubuntu 8.04 but actually don't have reproduced the bug since I bought this new PC.,0
"Yes, the patched kernel is for jaunty, but you don't need to change to jaunty to try it out. Simply download the linux-image .deb file for your architecture (i386 or amd64) and install it with gdebi or with dpkg -i then reboot into the new kernel.",0
the fix for zthe applet to not run on ltsp clients.,0
The problem is the same and the update don't resolve nothing....,0
"Tim, the option should be not defined by default, which means auto-rotate for best fit on image files.",0
"#10 Well, it actually is a bug.",0
Martin - It looks like with the fixes in DKMS and kernel that kernel-packages in Gutsy proposed is no longer relevant. I think it is safe to remove.,0
"Yes, I did, and it seems to work as a workaround",0
but i wouldn't call it the white screen of death.,0
This bug was fixed in the package epiphany-browser - 2.22.3-1ubuntu1,0
some flash videos wont play but its not really a showstopper IMHO. same package no changes needed other than changelog to get it to build and run in feisty.,0
I agree in full that the new problem of not being able to receive files from Symbian devices is a new problem and should be tracked in a different bug.,0
I don't agree with the priority assignment either.,0
"I had the bug just after installing ubuntu. So it was with the normal configuration. I have another Ubuntu 7.10 virtualized using Virtual Box and it is affected by this bug, so you can try if you want.",0
the script-fu-select-to-foo scripts are deprecated and do not any longer register a menu entry,0
i absolutely agree that this should be marked high priority.,0
"We don't need most of the information you post, we'll tell you when we want something more.",0
"Hi, I am relatively new to Ubuntu. I am presently using HP 6940 and I have the same complaints. I tried the 'sudo aa-complain cupsd' command with no luck.",0

Brian this fix seems to of worked I now have a res of 1280x800 :) Many thanks.,0
I just tried Kai's fix on a Dell Inspiron 1501 Radeon Xpress 200M runnning Gutsy. No luck though!,0

it is still not fixed.,0
"Hi, on my acer-extensa 5620 i had the same problem with internal mic.",0
"i don't think this is worthy of an sru, but it will get picked up the next gutsy lum release.",0
"Hi Dan, new package needs to be included in current Ubuntu development version first before it can be considered for a stable release. Then then the package go though SRU or backport process. I hope this helps.",0
I don't think that this should be dependent on being able to resize freely at all...,0
It is very useful tool and I use it weekly to manage my photos and videos.,0
Update - Aaron says he does not have an ETA for adding 8400M support.,0
I have a customer reporting this same issue and looking forward to provide any further information needed to advance this through resolution.,0
Still not working for me.,0
i also get this error on booting the live cd on my desktop here are the specs of the computer.,0
"The desktop apps didn't slow down significantly or grey out at all (I was running FF3 RC1, a vmware VM, and Thunderbird). I also recently switched to the 32bit kernel, but I don't think the 32bit 2.6.24-17 kernel was any different from the amd64 one with respect to desktop responsiveness under disk I/O load.",0
Indeed the package in proposed is working. Thanks,0

This was working fine for me on my ThinkPad X61T laptop until the latest Kernel this worked fine.,0
"I firstly failed to connect to a unsecured network, but then after that failed, I tried the WPA2 EAP-TTLS/PAP network, and it connected. NM still doesn't store anything in the gnome-keyring, which seems broken in general.",0
I can confirm that Shawn Fisher's fix works just fine on my machine.,0
"sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start Does not work, I get a blank screen.",0
"This was confirmed as fixed for two people, Chris still experienced it.",0
This issue was once fixed already and I have a feeling that this isn't system-config-printer related anymore.,0
I think the most simple solution to this is just to have a simple key for all PPAs.,0
I was able to find the NLS class but I didn't find the BundleFinder class.,0

you've a long running connection to a web server where you're downloading lots of data so i don't think it's the same cause.,0
"Thank you Daniel Stoyanov for your report, is the crash reproducible? if so, would you please indicate a test case to reproduce it. Indicate which extensions/plugins do you have enabled. Thanks in advance",0

Yeah. I thought about ext4 too.,0
"I think I still can't really ask for sponsorship in this upload, and the next one, didn't know dput would have commented here.",0
Thanks Helton. I have put it in rc.local for now.,0
"No pauses, no windows greying out, and FF3 was responsive all the way through. It's a pity that the server kernel doesn't configure the sound card etc, otherwise I'd just use it instead of the generic one.",0
I agree that Albert's idea makes sense.,0
"One more comment on this; I can understand the ""conservative"" behaviour, but when an array was degraded, the boot process halted with NO MESSAGE indicating what was wrong.",0

"Ok, I don't want to hijack the bug comments but if you're interested here's my xorg.conf for xinerama with fglrx which works with no kernel module as described.",0
My experience has been the same as Don Melcer's (above);,0
you bug report is probably not related to this one as it is about a different video card.,0
i agree that the names are quite confusing,0

Works for me. Thanks Sebastien!,0
I don't think I had them with 52... It happens if my mouse happens to sweep through all the icons on my dock. The only way to get the titles to disappear is to hover back over the icon.,0

i disagree that it is a regression that is critical for feisty;,0

"I've looked around for ages searching for a solution, following everything that has been mentioned or linked to in the posting above to no avail.",0
I think I may have this same bug with Intrepid Ibex.,0

I'm seeing a similar problem since the gutsy upgrade that would kind of support the video thesis of naught101.,0

Hi there!! I was facing the same problem of you guys.,0
Simple answer: no.,0
but I'm not convinced that the corruption is caused by libc6 because corruption of other packages have occurred as well.,0
i don't think this is a driver problem either.,0
"Hi Richard, thanks for the notice on that commit.",0
commenting the virtual line in xorg did not work for me.,0
This is fixed in our current local repository and it will be part of the next upload.,0
"Looks like they're still working on the ath5k driver, however, since it's been included in the master kernel git tree it means that it's passed whatever standards drivers typically need to be included in the kernel.",0
"johannes, i agree with peter, there is a 180 second delay in the code in an ""if"" block just before the suggested location for the patch.",0
"hardy didn't manage any better either, and both were clean installs.",0
"I believe this bug (""The suspend scripts do not restore the cpufreq governor on resume."") is the same as this other bug from 2006:",0
"Hi, not at all, I don't have access to the server nor can ask the admins to change this policy company wide.",0
We've put some fixes in and they've not worked as well as we'd like so there's still some work to do.,0
"malcolm: no, i cannot confirm this.",0
I can confirm that this is busybox. I get segfaults when calling 'busybox mount -o move ...',0
It does not happen every time to me either!,0
Same happens to me on Ubuntu Karmic alpha 6 (64bit) with Firefox 3.5 and flash 10.0.32.18,0
so I don't think that is the problem.,0
It'd be helpful if you were to do some research into this extension and add information about its license etcetera to the wiki page,0
I thought I waited long enough - I had read that comment about the 180s delay - but I didn't. I just tested it again and booting with a detached disc continues after 3 minutes.,0
I agree with vnieto. Simon's route is fine too.,0
Found another small regression.,0
i have the switch user white screen problem as described by exactt as well,0
So the workaround isn't reliable and this package should have it's importance put back to 'High' or at least 'Medium'.,0
"Thanks, Michael Hofmann, for the testing. Patch approved for feisty-proposed",0
Stathis nothing happens.The problem still exist.,0
I have no objection to closing this out and considering it an extension problem.,0
this is not an update to the existing driver as much as a request for an additional driver.,0

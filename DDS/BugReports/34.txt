**Steps to Reproduce**
1. In VSCode, open two terminals
2. Inspect the terminal tabs using chrome devtools
3. Notice that both terminal tabs have `aria-label="[object Object]"`

**Source Code**
It seems the issue might be here (`options.title` can be of type `string` or `ITooltipMarkdownString`): https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/ae774a04cf1f5ecfc03d79165f30b8001cde862d/src/vs/base/browser/ui/iconLabel/iconLabel.ts#L140-L142
Hello can anyone assign this issue to me?
Hi, @meganrogge. 
I was looking into this issue, and like @SimonSiefke suspected, it seems like in this instance, the aria-title is a Markdown string, which is why it's showing up as an object. 
I'm not exactly sure what the best way to handle the Markdown string would be. 
However, using the tooltip label marks the aria-label as "$(terminal) zsh." 
Would that be sufficient, or should I look for another solution? 
Not exactly sure of the guidelines surrounding aria. Thanks!
Can you call `.toString()` on the markdown string? 
If not, using the tooltip seems fine.
Unfortunately, toString doesn't solve the problem.

This is what the input is getting as ITooltipMarkdownString. 
Because the IIconLabelValueOptions interface accepts both a string or a markdown string for the title, I'm unsure of a function that will allow me to just get the markdown property without causing other issues. 
Plus, in this case, I don't know if the string is even suitable for an aria-label. 
However, if the tooltip works, I'll run tests and submit a PR soon.

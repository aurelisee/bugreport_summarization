Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>
Trying to install new extenstions.
(Atlassian and GitLens) Gives Notification saying "failed to install [insert program name here]" The notification window contains a Download Manually button option.
 The manual download button starts downloading a VISX, but when installing, it fails saying "One or more extensions are for Visual Studio Code.
Try installing them in Visual Studio Code." There are no failure reasons in the output window, or any way to get failure details.

Also seeing this on today's Insiders.
Console logs:

And this after manually installing extension:

- VSCode Version: latest

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Update your system to latest macOS
2.Try to install anything
<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check.-->
Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No ...
I've deleted Code and even `rm -Rf` the `Code` folder in `Application Support` but even after doing that, and reinstalling the latest version of VSCode I cannot install any extension.
![Screen Shot 2020-05-28 at 3 37 18 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/989648/83185537-24a02f80-a0f9-11ea-9b72-c7d0f088261b.png)
Also, I had extensions installed but they were gone...which is what lead me to this point.
By gone I mean VSCode did not load them.
Same problem here using Ubuntu 20.04 with vs insiders version 1.46-insider.

I just tried giving VSCode full disk access to my mac...figured maybe it was a permission issue on my end or something specific to 10.15.5 or something silly.
Still won't install anything.

Can you please verify if you can able to install extensions on latest insiders?
Yes, thanks! Installing extensions is working again.

@sandy081 I can install extensions (after release with fix as well as latest Insiders build).
Quick note about problem that I saw couple of times, but can\'t get enough investigation for separate issue ATM.
However it looks like extension uninstall is broken:
1.install extension and Reload window
2.Try to remove extension: I can see progress indicator above the list, but list is not updated (also I think search also broken after that)
3.Reload window - extension I tried to uninstall still in the list, but I see "Extensions have been modified on disk.
Please reload the window." notification.
4.Click on Reload window in notification  - extension is gone
Can you repro this problem or need more info needed in separate issue?
Doesn\'t happen if I close VS Code after extension installation.
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>
Installing an extension doesn't work anymore.

Seems separate issue and unrelated to this.
Please file a separate issue with step to repro.

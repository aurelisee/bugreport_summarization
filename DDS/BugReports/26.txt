- OS Version: macOS Sonoma 14.1
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a task in task.json with this format
   ```
      {
          "label": "go mod tidy",
          "type": "shell",
          "command": "go mod tidy",
          "group": "build",
          "presentation": {
              "reveal": "always",
              "panel": "new",
              "focus": true,
              "echo": true
          },
      },
   ```
2. Open an editor window if not already open
3. Run the task
4. Notice that the cursor stays in the editor so the terminal must be clicked on to press enter and dismiss the task
'I have the same fault in the same version of VSCode.'
Same problem with:
```

OS: Linux x64 5.15.0-88-generic snap
```
My task looks like this:
```
      {
          "label": "Flash firmware",
          "type": "shell",
          "command": "invoke flash",
          "presentation": {
              "echo": true,
              "reveal": "always",
              "focus": true,
              "panel": "shared",
              "showReuseMessage": false,
              "clear": false
          },
          "problemMatcher": []
      }

Exactly the same here.

- VS Code Version: 1.84.2
- OS Version: Windows 10 64-bit v. 10.0.19045
- C++/ C extension: v1.
17.5
Steps to Reproduce:
In `tasks.json` in C++ folder in `presentation`, `focus` is `true`
It used to work, but now it doesn't work.
For example, it was very convenient when, after compilation, the output window was focused, and this made it possible to close the window by pressing Enter.
Now, regardless of whether true or false is selected for `focus`, the window is not focused.
You have to click on the window after compilation and only then press Enter to close it.

I'm having this problem too, but it seems like it's working again in the pre-release version of 1.85 (`1.85-insider`). 
I don't know what changeset might have fixed it though.

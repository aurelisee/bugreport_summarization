> PHP defines HTML as an embedded language here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/php/package.json#L44.
The bug is that VSCode doesn't activate 'html' when it needs it's indent rules.
As HTML defines the indent rules in code, activation is necessary.
> It's a VSCode issue.
I suggest to create a new issue and assign it to @alexdima.

This PR fixes #62077.
## Testing the change
1.Create new file.
2.Change file type to PHP.
3.Type in some nested matching html tags without manually indenting the line:
a.Without the change.
```
<div>
<div>
</div>
</div>
```
b.
With the change.
```
<div>
    <div>
    </div>
</div>
```
Currently, the `onLanguage` activation event fires only when a file that resolves to a certain language gets opened -- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events#onLanguage -- and **not when encountering an embedded language as part of tokenization**.
I am not 100% convinced we should activate all embedded languages.
e.g.Is it expected to activate `java` when writing markdown and using fenced code blocks?
If the experience of `php` is so dependent on `html`, shouldn't the `php` extension take a dependency on the `html` extension?
FYI @aeschli
via `extensionDependencies`?
Could also do that.
But it makes sense to me that if I want to add rules for the 'foo' language, then I always get activated when those rules would be applied to a region in some file.
Currently, the `language-configuration.json` is read when encountering an embedded language.
This is done [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a59cde5933e9e3150cfd6460cdabc853032d5a91/src/vs/workbench/contrib/codeEditor/browser/languageConfigurationExtensionPoint.ts#L85-L87).
But I think this must be something that the `html` extension does via API and not via the `language-configuration.json`?
We want at one point to move also the `onEnter` rules to the `language-configuration.json`, perhaps that's what's missing here?
Yeah, the html extension uses `vscode.languages.setLanguageConfiguration` with onEnterRules, wordPattern, and indentationRules.
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>
Since any of the last updates, the html parts of php file don't autoindent with proper linebreaks as before.
 This happens in all my VS code instalations with 1.46.1 on W7, with or without any extension installed.
I mean, when I hit enter in:
```
<div>|</div>
```
I get only a regular linebreak and not the extraline and indentation I get in a html file.
 I noticed that if I open an html file and come back to the php file, the autoindentation temporarily wors again until you close and reopen de php file.
 So annoying.
 I hope thi can be fixed asap.
 Thank you very much.

This has been the case for awhile, tracking in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98621
Hi!
Is there any workaround for this?
I have an autocompletion extension that works with `onLanguage` activation and I'd like to have it working when the language is used as `embeddedLanguage`.
Thanks.
Since we now support defining regular expression in `language-configuration.json` files, we could simply move the `setLanguageConfiguration` calls to the JSON files.
This fixes #98621.
**Edit from @alexdima:** Since a couple of milestones, it is possible to express everything in the language configuration files, including the `wordPattern` and the `onEnterRules`.
It is preferable to express the language configuration in JSON because this allows those features to work even when the main extension is not activated.

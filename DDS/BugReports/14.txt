1.Open any document
2.Open any extension (see readme)
3.Click en [|] button for see Two Columns Layouts
Result: all tabs are hidden
I could repro in stable though after reproing once, it didn't happen 100% of the time.
Console error
```

This happens 100% on all three flavors of VSCode, with the first run when opening an extension preview on clean editor state and trying `Split Editor`.
It seems like webview is detached and reattached by vscode during this action while some pending events are fired which results in this error.

@mjbvz thoughts ?
It is great to have a repro for this as it spams our error telemetry with lots of errors and we have not been able to figure this out yet.
See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/79165

Split was causing the webview in the extension editor to be reparented, which caused this cryptic error

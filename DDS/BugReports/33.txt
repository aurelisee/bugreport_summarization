Do you have any settings related to gutters that you've modified?
No, I haven’t modified any related settings. 
And after suspecting it was a git issue, I’ve upgraded git to the latest version, but the problem still hasn’t been resolved.
I found a stable way to reproduce the problem:
Step:
1. Open a file
2. Click "Ctrl + \ " (notebook.cell.split)
3. Close the split

@alexr00, do you mind taking an initial look at this? 
Thanks!
@XenoMeri thanks for the repro steps!
This pull request fixes the issue where the editorGutter element in the editor disappears. 
The issue was caused by the dirtydiffDecorator not properly disposing of the item when the editor is no longer visible. 
The fix involves checking if the item exists before disposing of it and deleting it from the map if it is empty. 
Fixes #195762.

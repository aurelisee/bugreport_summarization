I tested on Win11 & Win10.
It works as long as you start a new workbook and don't save the Jupyter notebook. 
Once you save the notebook, your pastes of images from the clipboard will no longer be treated as inline attachments.

Possibly getting overridden by a markdown file paste provider? @mjbvz
@amunger were you able to replicate my findings?

Reviewed this thoroughly and found the following.
All cases are performed with a screenshot copied to the clipboard and pasting into markdown notebook cells using ctrl+v. 
Using Windows 11 and current insiders. 
`Commit: 7dff07893ac160244db210e574eccc05f1cba2cb`
With setting `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": false`
- Unsaved notebook (command palette -> new Jupyter notebook -> `Untitled-1.ipynb`)
  - `ctrl+v` results in a broken markdown image link pasted, broken rendering (see screenshots attached)

- Saved notebook
  - Creates image file on disk, creates markdown image link, renders correctly.
With setting `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": true`

With the above investigation, I believe this is likely an issue with markdown paste providers, assigning @mjbvz to take a look at this.
@beckerben, to clarify, are you expecting the images to be created on-disk upon paste and referenced via an image markdown link? 
Or are you looking for the `attachment:filename` experience, with images stored in the notebook itself. 
The latter can be achieved and still works properly with the setting `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": true`
I prefer the latter, where the images are stored in the notebook; this makes it easier to share with others in these scenarios. 
This used to be working and then stopped working in the build I noted in the original question referenced, but I just tested in the latest build and it is back to working as expected, so must have been a bug that has now been fixed:
The version I just tested with is updated now and it is working as expected with the `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": true`

Works fine for me too with the default settings. 
Will disable pasting into untitled notebooks with the setting off
Fixes #194809
Since the notebook does not exist on disk yet, there's no way to write a relative path in it. 
Just disable the feature since there's nothing else we can reasonably do here

https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13089 but for .rpm
Notes:
- Chromium deps: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/installer/linux/rpm/expected_deps_i386?dr=C&q=libxss.so.1&sq=package:chromium
- `ldd /usr/share/code-insiders/code-insiders` can fetch a list of deps
Fixes #17142
---
The list of dependencies are those that appear in Chromium's expected dependencies and the output of `ldd /usr/share/code-insiders/code-insiders`
To verifier: Please verify installation works fine on both a 32-bit and 64-bit CentOS (I tested using Fedora when implementing).
- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: CentOS 7.3 (x64)
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install CentOS 7.3 minimal ISO to a new VM
2.sudo yum install code-1.8.1-1482158209.el7.x86_64.rpm
3.code .
Expected:
VS Code to start
Actual:
VS Code crashes, saying it cannot find libgtk-2.0.so
I then manually installed the "gtk2" rpm to meet the missing dependency.
VS Code still crashes, saying it cannot find libXtst.so.
I installed the "libXtst" rpm
VS Code still crashes, saying it cannot find libgconf-2.0.so
I installed the "GConf2" rpm
VS Code starts, but immediately and silently exits.
Running with the --verbose option eventually points to a failure to locate a "sans" font.
I installed the "gnu-free-sans-fonts" rpm
VS Code successfully starts and is operational.
So it seems like the above 4 packages should be added as package dependencies, to avoid the user having to manually find/install additional packages.
Thanks for reaching out! Interestingly, it seems that all four of those packages appear in [dependencies.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/resources/linux/rpm/dependencies.json), so not sure what's up.
@Tyriar, any ideas?
This is fixed Insiders, coming in 1.9.0 ðŸ˜„ https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17142
@Tyriar Seeing this on CentOS 8.6 64-bit live CD:

Consistently so for the 32-bit version:

CentOS 7 build 1611 64-bit live DVD installs the package, but the crashes on startup of VSCode.
--verbose shows:

Changing the permissions as asked for fixed the problem.
Not sure if there is a way to avoid that, but other applications don't seem to require that change in permissions.
Hey there,
I took on the challenge to install vscode on void linux from source.
The installation doesn't list all dependencies I needed.
These were pkg-config, libXScrnSaver, gconfmm.
Now its working, with the only exception being the integrated terminal.
Would be neat if you could update the installation notes.

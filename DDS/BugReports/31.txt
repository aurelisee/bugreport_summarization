- VS Code Version: 1.83 & 1.84-insider NOT: 1.80.2
- OS Version: macOS AMD64
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Provide code action via language server. Example from [Snyk Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner):
```
{"command":{"arguments":["https://learn.snyk.io/lesson/csrf-attack/?loc=ide"],"command":"snyk.openBrowser","title":"Learn more about Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Snyk)"},"diagnostics":[{"code":"javascript/UseCsurfForExpress","codeDescription":{"href":"https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/security-rules-used-by-snyk-code"},"message":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): CSRF protection is disabled for your Express app. This allows the...","range":{"end":{"character":18,"line":27},"start":{"character":10,"line":27}},"severity":2,"source":"Snyk Code"}],"kind":"quickfix","title":"Learn more about Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Snyk)"}
```
2. When opening the `Quickfixes...` menu, the code action command is automatically executed on mouse-over/selection.
This is happening with current vscode versions, but not with 1.80.2 released in June, both using the same Snyk extension version. 
Therefore we think that a change in VSCode or one of its language server / language client related libraries is triggering this unexpected behaviour.

@luizcamposmc I was unable to reproduce this. Does this happen in the latest 1.84 release and is it only with flutter/dart?
closing as it's a /duplicate https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/196589

Repro:
1. Windows (maybe not needed?)
2. Set `"terminal.integrated.developer.devMode": true`
3. Open terminal
4. Write some text, note the cursor location
5. Focus an editor
6. Focus the terminal, ???? the cursor is at the start of the textbox

Works on Mac.
It also works for me on Windows.
@Tyriar any other steps required?
I think the repro is to fill the viewport such that there's a scroll bar, then type.
Ctrl+c helps make it happen too.
Some other repros too:

I'm hitting this:
```
CommandDetectionCapability#_handleCommandStartWindows reached max attempts, [true,null]
```
Looking into it.
- PowerShell is now handled with a specific regex which has an optional space at the end; if matched, a space will be added to the end. This is needed because conpty may not 'render' the final space in the prompt.
- Return true in _cursorOnNextLine check if there is a single command, as this means it's the first command, so any match should be correct.
- Increase polling to 1000ms (50x20ms) as it was being hit on my machine.
Fixes #196758

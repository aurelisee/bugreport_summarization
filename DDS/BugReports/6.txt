I am pretty sure this is a bug; however I just checked on the Windows 10 version of VSC and while it doesn\'t assign *.gyp as an extension, instead using the proper *.py, it does list it as one of the extensions recognized as a Python file
As far as I am aware, I have never encountered *.gyp files in any coding context outside of node-gyp and associated infrastructure for Chromium.

The following file extensions are registered as python: `".py
.rpy
.pyw
.cpy
.gyp
.gypi
.pyi
.ipy"`
I don\'t know how the Save As dialog picks what extension to show by default
This seems like standard Electron behaviour, I can reproduce in a Fiddle and Electron seems to pick a random entry where I would expect it should pick the first:
```js
dialog.showSaveDialog(mainWindow, {
      filters: [
        {
          name: 'Python',
          extensions: [
            'py',  'rpy',
            'pyw
cpy',
            'gyp
gypi',
            'pyi
ipy'
          ]
        },
      ]
    });
```
Maybe @deepak1556 can check how its implemented in Electron and file the issue in their repo.
Also happening on Mojave (10.14.6)
Seems like it's also happening for other languages in the dropdown that have multiple file types.
C++ defaults to .hxx
HTML defaults to .asp
JSON defaults to .jscsrc
etc etc

The filename extension order is not suitable when saving a file
For example, when saving a file and choose 'Java' In the 'Save as type' drop-down menu, the file will be saved as '.class' file by default
Because the Java item shows like this: Java(*.class; *.java; *.jav; .java; .jav), '*.class' before of '*.java'
that can confuse some users.

@gonghenghai what operating system are you running?
Same for macOS Catalina 10.15.5.
Save the Untitled file to Java format, the default filename extension is .class
It should be .java.

@bpasero When i tried to save an Untitled file to Java format in macOS, the default file extension is still `.class`
Looks like this issue is not fixed with the latest upstream electron.
I cannot reproduce that, steps:
* new untitled file
* hit `Cmd+S`
* pick Java from the dropdown

By using the insider at 2020-09-15, actually i can reproduce it in both windows 10 and macOS 10.15.5

@testforstephen you possibly have a Java extension installed?
Does it reproduce when you disable that extension?
Yes, disable all installed extensions, the default extension name becomes `.java`
I'm wondering how the Java extension affect the file save logic?
@aeschli can you advise what an extension needs to do to get `.java` as first entry?
I assume they need to change the order in `package.json`?
Java extension added the following section to package.json.
```json
{
  "contributes":
   {
    "languages": [
      {
        "id": "java",
        "extensions": [
          ".class"
        ],
        "configuration": "./language-configuration.json"
      }
    ]
  }
```
If i added ".java" before ".class" in "extensions" field, the Untitled file will be saved to `.java` by default
But for Windows, the file extension candidates will contain a duplicated .java in file dialog
Is there any way to fix this?

@testforstephen I pushed a fix for the duplicated file extensions (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/02cf31cda7af3d38200d61ddcc05bbde1dc1d37f)
@aeschli Cool, thanks for the quick fix.
Reported as https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/25152
This is fixed with Electron 9.3.0.

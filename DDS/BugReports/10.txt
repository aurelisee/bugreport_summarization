VS Code Insider and Stable on macOS 11.0.1 (Big Sur):
The "Restart to Update" does not restart VS Code on macOS 11.0.1 (Big Sur).
But the update works fine: after a manual start VS Code is updated.
Upstream fix https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25864, should be fixed in our exploration builds, needs to be backported to `9-x-y`
macOS Big Sur VS Code insiders
1.get an update and download the update
2.Main menu (or Gear) -> click on the Restart button so the update gets applied
3.VS Code insiders is closed but does not start 🐛
If I manualy start VS Code after this all is good and I see the update applied.

If you do not have Big Sur let me know what more details I can provide to best help.
/duplicate #109728
@deepak1556 It would be ideal if we could backport this and include it for November so Big Sur stable users don't hit this issue the next few updates.
Would a backport be possible?
For Electron versions < 11 , squirrel is downloaded as a prebuilt binary from https://github.com/electron/electron-frameworks which hasn't bumped versions in a long time.
For electron 11 and higher squirrel is built from source, which made it easier to pick up fixes.
So backporting a fix to Electron 9 at this late stage in release is difficult.
**Discussion from Zürich standup**
On Big Sur, the action is still to be called `Restart to Update`.
When clicking it, a modal dialog should come up explaining this is broken in Big Sur, with a link to the issue, and an action to Quit VS Code.
@joaomoreno will this change be included only for release/1.52 branch ? Since master is already on Electron 11
I will include the modal dialog *only* on the release branch, and keep this issue open.

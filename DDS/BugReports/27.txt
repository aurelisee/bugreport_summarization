Type: **Bug**
When I open VS Code, everything works fine, but when I try to press any shortcuts for the sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+E, among others), it doesn't respond. Even so, open-close sidebar and terminal panel still work (Ctrl+J, Ctrl+B).
This issue is only fixed by restarting the editor, but it only works once or twice.

This is probably related to the `"workbench.activityBar.location": "hidden"` setting. 
Adding more clarity on the issue, here's what I found:
- If the Activity Bar is set to hidden and you close and reopen VSCode, the keyboard shortcuts to show the Explorer, Extensions, and Debugger panels in the primary sidebar no longer work. 
The setting to show these panels is also gone from the control panel in this situation (such as `View: Show Explorer`).
- If you hide the Activity Bar during a session (without closing and reopening VSCode), these issues don't appear. It's only after reopening VSCode when the Activity Bar was previously set to hidden that these issues appear.
- In the control panel, after you select "View: Hide Activity Bar," there is no option to show it again. 
There should be a setting for "View: Show Activity Bar."
- If the Activity Bar is hidden and you select "View: Focus Activity Bar," the UI space for the Activity Bar will be revealed, but the Activity Bar content will still be hidden.

1. Click the dropdown caret
2. Hover over an enum value
3. :bug: dropdown appears in top left

I have seen this occasionally too, but haven't discovered a repro.
Perhaps #197987 is related.
See also #197755
For me, this reproduces 100% of the time precisely when I hover over the dropdown list values, and I even repro it when the settings UI is the only active editor (no splitview or gridview)
I'm able to repro https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/197755, but I'm unable to repro this issue where the context menu already goes to the top-left while still in the Settings editor.
@joyceerhl if you repro, then please `vscode-bisect` it to the change!
???? `vscode-bisect` claims there is no released insiders for 657bb89984f37b810b250955570593cde0cd62eb even though I got that from the insiders builds page after checking `Show released only` based on https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/197755#issuecomment-1811538701

I cannot repro in Code-OSS :( 
@joyceerhl `vscode-bisect` goes over unreleased builds as well. 
What is the commits range?
@rzhao271 found that he could repro https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/197755 between 1.78.2 and 1.79.2
@joyceerhl thats a different bu
FWIW, I tried debugging in dev tools
* We relayout the context view on hover here https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e1c8870cd21051aaf9b2582d7b4dcea5d874bf08/src/vs/base/browser/ui/selectBox/selectBoxCustom.ts#L776
* On a good layout, `DOM.getDomNodePagePosition(this.view).top` and `DOM.getDomNodePagePosition(this.view).left` are 0 here https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e1c8870cd21051aaf9b2582d7b4dcea5d874bf08/src/vs/base/browser/ui/contextview/contextview.ts#L351-L352
* On a bad layout, `top` === `DOM.getDomNodePagePosition(this.view).top` and `left` === `DOM.getDomNodePagePosition(this.view).left`, so `this.view.style.top` and `this.view.style.left` get zeroed
@joyceerhl interesting, I wonder if maybe we cannot find the `window` for the element in `getDomNodePagePosition`, there were recent changes. 
Having a change in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/198269 to always ensure we fallback to the main window.
* open settings editor
* find/filter `inlineChat.showGutterIcon`
* select something from the dropdown
* ???? sometimes the dropdown shows at (0,0) but not always

Is there anything I should look out for? 
Probe for some dom element or something in the log I should check?
Yeah if at all this reproduces in a `vscode-bisect` session that would be cool.

Happy Coding!
Also seeing this issue as of tonight on latest `1.85.0-insider` build. 
When attempting to hover a dropdown list, it will jump to (0,0). 
Then when trying to hover it while it's at (0,0) will cause it to jump back to the list it came from.
It will continue to do this over and over, basically playing _"catch me if you can!"_ with the mouse.

I did not personally see this issue until tonight.
It started on a previous version of Insiders, but I allowed it to update before coming to file a bug report to see if it was a known issue that was already fixed. 
It is still happening on the latest. 
But seems to be happening less frequently now.
Edit: There is another bug with the dropdown menus that may potentially help with this issue as it has a similar effect. 
If you open the Settings UI, open a dropdown, then close the Settings UI window by clicking its 'x' in the tab, the dropdown list will remain visible. 
Hovering over this list will cause it to jump to (0,0) as well. _(Hovering on it at (0,0) wont cause it to keep moving in this situation though.)_
Here is a video showing this additional bug:

@bpasero I cannot repro anymore in the latest Insiders :+1:

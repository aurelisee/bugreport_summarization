- VS Code Version: 1.82.2, Commit abd2f3db, Electron: 25.8.1, inside flatpak
- OS Version: Linux x64 6.5.7-200.fc38.x86_64
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install vscode via flatpak
2. Remove access to filesystem /etc/shells (e.g. by restricting fs-access)
3. Start vscode instance and open a new terminal.
4. Log-output shows that /etc/shells cannot be read (obviously)
5. profile-settings for terminal are not considered properly
Explanation: Sometimes this file might not be accessible or available.
Thanks for creating this issue!

Trying to fix [#196493](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/196493).
I assume, this is the least invasive way of fixing the given issue: Usually profile-lookups are enabled (I backtraced calls until literal "true").
Semantically, this should result in expected behavior: If `/etc/shells` file does not exist, any attempt of reading it is useless.
Usually, this file is readable if available.
As this issue was really easy to find and fix just by reading the `main`-branch, I am very confident that this issue persists in the latest versions of `vscode`.
Maybe we should show a notification in this case.
I agree that a missing `/etc/shells` is a corner-case, but showing a notification (you mean that little notification-popup, @meganrogge?!?) seems a bit extreme? 
But I see your point: Maybe it's good to add a log-output or similar.
Containers are usually designed to be as slim as possible, thus not adding this file in a base-container image seems reasonable.
Needing to acknowledge a notification every time a user opens the program seems overly intrusive? 
A missing shells file just implies that the system does not provide that information. 
As there is already some way to configure the terminal profile explicitly, I don't consider the missing (and implicit!) system information harmful? 
Even with no configuration, the terminal stays somewhat usable _(no hard program-crash or similar!)_. 
In my case `sh` was used without configuration.
Is this the right set-up? The Terminal output is empty, no error or warning

Looks right to me given what OP wanted, ref https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/196493#issuecomment-1778131607.
Marking the issue as verified.

Thanks for creating this issue! It looks like you may be using an old version of VS Code; the latest stable release is 1.84.1. 
Please try upgrading to the latest version and check whether this issue remains.

Happy Coding!

I was actually incorrect when I posted my version number initially. I **am** definitely running on `1.84.1`. 
And the issue remains the same as my original post. 
I'm going to edit it to reflect the correct version.

I have the same issue, and I'm on `1.84.1` as well.

This issue seems to also affect me, I am currently using the insider build of VSCode, but I also tried the latest release, and it also has this bug.

I have the same problem on VS Code 1.84.1, Windows 11, disabling all installed extensions doesn't help.

I had the same problem, I installed an older version to fix it.

Same issue - v1.84.1

I have the same issue from nowhere. 
It started from the latest VS Code update.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

Hello, I want to report a problem with color selection.
When selecting a color in the RGBA color palette, it automatically closes and adds the wrong code.

Thanks for creating this issue! 
We figured it's covering the same as another one we already have. 
Thus, we closed this one as a duplicate. 
You can search for [similar existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22bug%22%20label%3A%22editor-color-picker%22).

Happy Coding!

Hi yes this issue was fixed in version 1.85. 
Let us know if you continue seeing this.

I will work on this issue

I can reproduce this issue on Ubuntu 22.04.2 with VS Code 1.84 installed as a Snap, and also with VS Code Insiders 1.85 (`f346494c77e1245505e53a2ddcab3bfb4ee52e08`) installed as a Snap.

I wonder if this is related in any way to #136965?

Related on Stack Overflow: [Why does the VS Code 1.84 color picker close after clicking any input in it?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/77429583/11107541)

Also related on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/17rc8h1/is_the_color_picker_supposed_to_close_once_you/

Same issue on v1.84.2

Are we going to fix it at all? 
The original issue has been posted since 2021. 
It's almost 2024 now.

@honguyenminh what do you mean? what issue ticket are you referring to? 
The one I mentioned above? 
Because I wasn't implying that they are the same issue, and if you compare the behaviour described, they are different. 
I was only asking (the maintainers) if they are _related_.

Fixes #197588.
### What I did
So the issue arose in 18.4.0 with #196709, in particular [this](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/33b2e4a29c4ff7f8e7c988f19add209bd53ed55e#diff-790d9803b8477b256b7f571260cda4f3d5b033b6405e3586bf3e98d08236087aR110) line.
The reason for the issue is that whenever a color is picked through any of the selectors, a change is immediately triggered on the editor. 
That triggers the editor's `onDidChangeModelContent` emitter, therefore the hover widget triggers the `_hideWidgets` method.
So it's actually a straightforward flow to understand: color picker changes editor content -> editor triggers emitter -> hover widget hides itself.

I have changed the method called on model content change so that we just cancel the scheduler and we don't hide the widget as well.
I just need some help with debugging the previous issue #196660 in order to make sure that this is not introducing regressions on that one.

Hey guys, I took a look and it was actually a recent change that caused the issue. 
If anyone wants to give feedback on the PR I just opened it'd be greatly appreciated. 
Hopefully, we can get this fixed soon!

same issue on
Version: 1.84.2 (user setup)

I have the same problem and because of this, I decided to downgrade to an older version.

Hi @mk8270 the fix is in Insiders 1.85 or the next release of stable, which will come out in two weeks. 
You may download the Insiders version of VS Code on https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/

What version of VS Code are you using @Irohukl?

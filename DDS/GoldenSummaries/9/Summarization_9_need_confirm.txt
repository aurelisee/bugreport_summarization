Have tried the fix in the insider, looks like the dirty text models don't exist any more. 
When moving files, the VS Code would modify the unsaved files again to restore the dirty state. 
If i want to enable refactoring feature based on the move operation, the silent didChange behavior from VS Code client probably conflicts with the refactoring job.
open fileA.ts that exports a symbol that is used in fileB.ts
rename a symbol in fileA.ts
(fileB.ts opens as a background tab)
save all
hit the x on the fileB.ts tab
observe (through logging) that fileB.ts is not disposed

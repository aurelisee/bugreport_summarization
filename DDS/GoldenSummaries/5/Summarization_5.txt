On python project interactive window open and try to switch to that group the cursor will disappear instead of going to the "command line". 
Then when trying to go back to editor with Cmd + 1, this won't work again 
it appears that webview within the panel doesn't receive focus when the user switches to a group
It sounds like the core focus is not restored once the interactive window is refocused. 
When a webview tab is focused, VS Code focused the webview element but it does not restore focus to any previously focused element within that webview

Save this file locally (it happens also with other files; this is a file I've been able to reproduce it consistently with)
Launch VSC
Open the file above
Tap Ctrl+K, V
Now, perform the following sequence without leaving the finger from Ctrl:
Ctrl + 1, Ctrl + End, Ctrl + 2, Ctrl + W
The keyboard is now locked! Tapping any key/combination doesn't have any effect.
clicking away from the python interactive window and then clicking on the interactive window tab

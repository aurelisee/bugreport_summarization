When attempting to hover a dropdown list, it will jump to (0,0). And when trying to hover it while it's at (0,0), it will cause it to jump back to the list it came from. It will continue to do this over and over, creating a loop of mouse chase. It happens even with settings UI is the only active editor (no splitview or gridview).
Initiated on a previous version of insiders, then updated before to file a bug report, hoping it was already resolved. Unfortunately, it is still happening on the latest update.

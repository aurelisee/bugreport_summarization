Hovering over a dropdown list results in it jumping to (0,0). Subsequent attempts to hover at (0,0) make it return to its original list, creating a repetitive mouse chase loop. This occurs even when the settings UI is the sole active editor without splitview or gridview.
The issue originated in a previous version of Insiders, and despite updating before filing a bug report, it persists in the latest update.

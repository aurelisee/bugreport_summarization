When I apply commit the post commit does not work
I had already checked if the update process changed this setting and checked again - git.postCommitCommand is still set to sync.
Expected: Command+Enter again performs the same action as the large button under the message input box - commit and sync.
i can use "command + enter" in the source control view and it works now
but it doesn't work if i use the command palette with "Git: Commit All"

Version: 1.71.0-insider

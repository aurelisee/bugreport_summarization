Extension host debug: reload window closes the debuggee
 it is probably related in how we handle reloads on vscode side
Based on the stopOnEntry flag EH debugging either uses --debugPluginHost or --debugBrkPluginHost, so if we want to have a minimal fix, we probably should only include an additional test for --debugPluginHost.
1. Open folder with extension
2. F5 extension
3. In extension's workbench try to open a different folder
4. -> Extension's workbench closes, but does not reopen with new folder

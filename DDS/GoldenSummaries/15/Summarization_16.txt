Peek Definition + ENTER doesn' go to definition anymore
"Press Enter Key" does not jump to the definition of the selected item with "White colored font 
The item already is both focused and selected, so pressing Enter won't fire a selection change event since the selection doesn't change.
pressing Shift + down arrow instead of Enter can be used as workaround.
The Enter key does not work in this situation.

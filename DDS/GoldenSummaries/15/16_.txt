Before the 1.38.0 update you simply pressed enter in "peek definition" (ALT+12) and it jumped to definition.
It seems that the item that got initially focus cannot be selected with Enter anymore
When there are multiple results with "Go to definition" search, "Press Enter Key" does not jump to the definition of the selected item with "White colored font ( the default selected item)".

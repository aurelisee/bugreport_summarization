if I load one with "Open loaded scripts", the query parameter is stripped.
That normalize code should only be executed if the source could not be found - otherwise `source` should not be `null` and the rawSource should be passed to the adapter.
VS Code should be able to determine that the file opened by clicking on a stackframe and the file opened by clicking in the Loaded Scripts Explorer are one and the same.

Consider how scmService.setValue works. It doesn't make changes if the passed value is the same, just returns. When invoked with transient = false, it first replaces the last history navigator value with the current _value, then adds the passed value. At the end, it updates the _value member with the passed value. Note that historyNavigator removes duplicates and always ends with an empty string. In the case of undo commit, setValue is called with transient = false, and the passed value is the undone commit message. This places the undone commit message at the end of the history navigator and in the _value member. However, any subsequent setValue with transient = false would overwrite and lose the last item in history navigator (undone commit message). To fix this, when transient = false, instead of replacing the last value, we should add the passed-in value as another node.

There is a problem with color selection. When selecting a color in the RGBA color palette, it automatically closes and adds the wrong code. It means that when change color through any of the selectors, a change is immediately triggered, which causes editor's onDidChangeModelContent emitter, therefore the hover widget triggers the _hideWidgets method. To fix changes were added the method called on model content change so that we just cancel the scheduler and we don't hide the widget. It is fixed in Insiders 1.85 version.

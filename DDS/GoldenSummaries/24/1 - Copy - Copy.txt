The issue arises because picking a color through any selector instantly triggers a change in the editor, consequently activating the editor's `onDidChangeModelContent` emitter. This, in turn, prompts the hover widget to invoke the `_hideWidgets` method. The flow is straightforward: color picker alters editor content, triggering emitter, leading to the hover widget hiding itself. To address this, modify the method invoked on model content change to cancel the scheduler without hiding the widget. The fix is in Insiders 1.85 or the next release of stable.

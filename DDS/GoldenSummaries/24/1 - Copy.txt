Picking a color triggers an instant change in the editor, making the hover widget hide. To fix it, the method is adjusted. This addresses a problem where selecting a color in the RGBA palette closes it and adds the wrong code. The change is in the method handling model content, canceling the scheduler without hiding the widget. The fix is in Insiders version 1.85 or the next stable release.

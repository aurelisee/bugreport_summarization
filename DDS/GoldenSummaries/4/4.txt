As of version 1.70, some buttons on toolbars appear to be unlabeled, or if they have, they are not being read by orca.
The lack of labels directly impacts accessibility, at least for those who use orca as a screen reader.
As a workaround you can use VS Code insiders https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ which already has the fix
What is missing is the aria-label, so this commit sets the aria-label on that inner element.

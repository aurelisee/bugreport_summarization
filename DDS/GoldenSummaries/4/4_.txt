Some buttons on toolbars appear to be unlabeled, or if they have, they are not being read by orca.
I use NVDA and it appears nearly all toolbar buttons are now unlabelled, making it hard to do anything I'm used to doing.
It seems like that changed, so the element that gets focus now has no aria-label set.

All of a sudden VS Code (preview) does not load changes made to the code, when restarting the debugger.
 this is about edit-and-continue (pause, edit code, resume).
Up until the last version, while debugging, whenever I would restart it would trigger saving of project files.
Expected behaviour for the restart button; is to stop the debugger, and run the debugger again based on the updated code.
set "Auto Save" to "afterDelay"
Install multi-command extension
Then replace the hotkey for Debug: Restart in keybindings.json:

use this hello.js:
and create a node.js launch config for hello.js
set "Auto Save" setting to "off"
make sure to have "Save Before Start" enabled
F5
modify the "hello world" string
press Restart button

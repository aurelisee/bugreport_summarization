Missing `/etc/shells` is an issue. If the file doesn't exist, attempting to read it is futile, although it's typically readable if available. Identifying and fixing this in the `main` branch gives confidence in its persistence in the latest `vscode` versions. Considering a notification for the missing `/etc/shells`, concerns about intrusiveness are noted. A better alternative may involve adding log output. The rational exclusion of this file in slim-designed base-container images aligns with container practices.
VS Code Version: 1.82.2
Electron: 25.8.1, inside flatpak
- OS Version: Linux x64 6.5.7-200.fc38.x86_64
1. Install vscode via flatpak
2. Remove access to filesystem /etc/shells (e.g. by restricting fs-access)
3. Start vscode instance and open a new terminal.
4. Log-output shows that /etc/shells cannot be read (obviously)
5. profile-settings for terminal are not considered properly

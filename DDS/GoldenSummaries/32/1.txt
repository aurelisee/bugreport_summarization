 `/etc/shells` is missing. The expected behavior is: If the `/etc/shells` file doesn't exist, any attempt to read it is pointless. Typically, the file is readable if it exists. Given that this issue was easily identified and fixed by examining the `main` branch, I am confident that it persists in the latest versions of `vscode`. The suggestion to show a notification for a missing /etc/shells is considered, but concerns about its intrusiveness are noted. A more suitable alternative could be adding log output or similar functionality. The absence of this file in base-container images for slim design is reasonable, considering container practices.
VS Code Version: 1.82.2
Electron: 25.8.1, inside flatpak
- OS Version: Linux x64 6.5.7-200.fc38.x86_64
1. Install vscode via flatpak
2. Remove access to filesystem /etc/shells (e.g. by restricting fs-access)
3. Start vscode instance and open a new terminal.
4. Log-output shows that /etc/shells cannot be read (obviously)
5. profile-settings for terminal are not considered properly

The absence of `/etc/shells` is the issue. Expected behavior is that attempting to read it when it doesn't exist is futile. Typically, the file is readable if available. Identifying and fixing this problem in the `main` branch gives me confidence that it persists in the latest `vscode` versions. Considering whether to display a notification for the missing `/etc/shells` is being discussed, with concerns about its intrusiveness acknowledged. A preferable alternative might be incorporating log output or similar functionality. The justifiably missing file in base-container images aligns with slim design practices in containers.
VS Code Version: 1.82.2
Electron: 25.8.1, inside flatpak
- OS Version: Linux x64 6.5.7-200.fc38.x86_64
1. Install vscode via flatpak
2. Remove access to filesystem /etc/shells (e.g. by restricting fs-access)
3. Start vscode instance and open a new terminal.
4. Log-output shows that /etc/shells cannot be read (obviously)
5. profile-settings for terminal are not considered properly

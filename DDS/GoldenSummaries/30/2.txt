When opening the terminal with "terminal.integrated.developer.devMode": true and focusing on it, the cursor will now appear at the beginning of the text box. For PowerShell, a specific regex has been implemented, including an optional space at the end. If matched, a space is added to the end, addressing rendering issues in conpty that may not display the final space in the prompt. In the _cursorOnNextLine check, returning true now occurs if there is a single command, indicating the first command and validating any match. To resolve issues on the user's machine, the polling interval has been extended to 1000ms (50x20ms).
Repro is to fill the viewport such that there's a scroll bar, then type.
Ctrl+c helps make it happen too.

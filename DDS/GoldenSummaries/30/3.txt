When using "terminal.integrated.developer.devMode": true, focusing on the terminal now places the cursor at the text box's start. For PowerShell, a regex with an optional space at the end is applied, addressing conpty rendering issues. Returning true in the _cursorOnNextLine check happens when there's a single command, indicating the first command and validating any match. To resolve machine-specific issues, polling is increased to 1000ms (50x20ms).

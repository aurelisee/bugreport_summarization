Previously, it was convenient that, after compilation, the output window automatically gained focus, allowing closure with a simple Enter press. However, regardless of the `focus` setting being true or false, the window no longer auto-focuses. Now, one needs to click on the window after compilation and then press Enter to close it. This issue is shared, but there's hope as it appears resolved in the pre-release version 1.85 (`1.85-insider`). Notably, the cursor stays in the editor, requiring a click on the terminal to press Enter and dismiss the task.

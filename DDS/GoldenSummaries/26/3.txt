Previously, the output window automatically gained focus after compilation, allowing closure with a simple Enter press. However, regardless of the `focus` setting, it no longer auto-focuses, requiring a click on the window after compilation and then pressing Enter to close it. This issue is common, but there's optimism as it appears resolved in the pre-release version (`1.85-insider`). The cursor remains in the editor, necessitating a click on the terminal to press Enter and dismiss the task.

When I reformat (or more subtly, when I hit Restart in a debugging session, which automatically saves, which fires format-on-save) the breakpoint ends up pointing at a totally different piece of code.
It seems like the editor does not update those decorations in that specific case.
it is inconsistent to compute more minimal edits when formatting explicitly, but not when formatting on save.

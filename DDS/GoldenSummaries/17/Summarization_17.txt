When I reformat (or more subtly, when I hit `Restart` in a debugging session, which automatically saves, which fires format-on-save) the breakpoint ends up pointing at a totally different piece of code. 
It seems like the editor does not update those decorations in that specific case.
Open an empty folder and add a file with the following content
Create a format provider that returns the same data without the empty lines
Now enable formatOnSave, add the breakpoint and hit Save. Then undo and choose Format Document

The bug is that VSCode doesn't activate 'html' when it needs it's indent rules. 
Since any of the last updates, the html parts of php file don't autoindent with proper linebreaks as before.
I noticed that if I open an html file and come back to the php file, the autoindentation temporarily wors again until you close and reopen de php file.

Copying and pasting images in a new Jupyter workbook works fine, but if you save the notebook, the pasted images don't show up correctly. When `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled"` is set to `false`:
- Pasting (`ctrl+v`) gives a broken image link.
- Pasting creates an image file on disk, adds a markdown link, and shows correctly.
When set to `true`:
- Pasting gives a correct image link, and it shows up fine.
This issue seems related to copying images in markdown. Using `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": true` helps share images within the notebook, and it's working well in the latest test, fixing a problem in a previous version.

It works when starting a new workbook, but once you save the Jupyter notebook, pasting clipboard images no longer works as inline attachments. With `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": false`:
- `ctrl+v` results in a broken markdown image link.
- Creates image file on disk, creates markdown image link, renders correctly.
With `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": true`:
- `ctrl+v` results in correct inline attachment image link, renders correctly.
This issue seems related to markdown paste providers; further investigation is needed. Achieving the desired `attachment:filename` experience is possible with `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": true`, making it easier to share images stored in the notebook. While the problem occurred in a previous build, the latest test indicates it's now working as expected.

This happens with the first run when opening an extension preview on clean editor state and trying Split Editor. 
It seems like webview is detached and reattached by vscode during this action while some pending events are fired which results in this error.
Split was causing the webview in the extension editor to be reparented, which caused this cryptic error
Result: all tabs are hidden.

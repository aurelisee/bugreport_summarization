It seems like webview is detached and reattached by vscode during this action while some pending events are fired which results in this error.
when i open an extension window, then i click on the split screen button, it say error idk what it say, then the window is closed and blank, i cant open my file window again
Split was causing the webview in the extension editor to be reparented, which caused this cryptic error

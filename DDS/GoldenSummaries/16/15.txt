VS Code crashes, saying it cannot find libgtk-2.0.so or libXtst.so or libgconf-2.0.so
Certain distros don't include some base deps and VS Code will install successfully but not launch without manually installing the deps it complains about.
So it seems like the above 4 packages should be added as package dependencies, to avoid the user having to manually find/install additional packages.
This is fixed Insiders, coming in 1.9.0
Installing libicu seems to have cleared that up.

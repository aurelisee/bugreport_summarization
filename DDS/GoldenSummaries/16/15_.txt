VS Code crashes, saying it cannot find libgtk-2.0.so, libXtst.so, libgconf-2.0.so
So it seems like the above 4 packages should be added as package dependencies, to avoid the user having to manually find/install additional packages.
Certain distros don't include some base deps and VS Code will install successfully but not launch without manually installing the deps it complains about.
The list of dependencies are those that appear in Chromium's expected dependencies and the output of ldd /usr/share/code-insiders/code-insiders
This is fixed Insiders, coming in 1.9.0
Installing libicu seems to have cleared that up.

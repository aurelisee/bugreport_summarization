The folders pane in Thunderbird that lists my e-mail accounts and local folders does not allow me to select several folders at once.
For instance I should be able to click on my James folder to select it, shift-click on my John folder to select it without deselecting the James folder, and then drag them *both* into my Friends folder.
The first folder is deselected.
Expected Results:
Kept both selected.
Possibly there are other conventions on other platforms for multiple selections.
But multiple selections should be possible,
This is highly-desirable in my opinion.
This is pretty basic stuff.
It's been a bit of a showstopper when migrating Outlook users over to Thunderbird since heavy users often have tons of folders to organise their emails.
Importing their mail just dumps these folders into Local Folders and then they can't be re-organised in their inbox without going through them all one-by-one, which is just silly.
On latest trunk multiple folders can be selected but there is completely no benefit of it: on drag and drop only 1 folder is moved, CM shows only 3 entries (open, open in new tab, properties) and even they are useless ;) (nothing happens / empty tab).
proposed fix
The items that I think make sense for multi select:
Get Messages
o if only servers, or it's only newsgroups/feeds
Open
o though I question that we should have this item *at all*
Open in new Tab
Unsubscribe
o if it's newsgroups only
Delete
o would have been useful, but the confirmation dialogs are not in js, we have multiple delete models etc so i gave up and just disabled it for multi selection
Compact

When typing in the search box, sometimes search-suggestion entries would be displayed above the divider (where entries for previous matching searches are).
The problem here is that nsSearchSuggestions.js is passing the wrong previousResult to form history.
Instead of it being the previous form history search result, it's the SuggestAutoCompleteResult result (which contains the union of the form-history and search-suggest entries).
So, when form history refines its results as you time, it can actually add *more* entries as data leaks from the suggestions result into form history result, and it thus looks like the divider is being drawn in the wrong place.
The search-suggestion result is only implements nsIAutoCompletResult (no \"Simple\"), so the QI fails, historyResult nee previousResult becomes null, and thus Satchel was doing a new search every time.

This fixes the problem, but isn't quite correct...
Ah. So, there's a ._formHistoryResult in the SuggestAutoCompleteResult wrapper (used to combine form history with search suggestions), and also a ._formHistoryResult in SuggestAutoComplete (the service itself, used to hold onto a form history result until a search suggestion is available).
The simple fix it to just discard the service's form history result copy when startSearch() is called with a null previous result.
Perhaps we should rename one of them to _fhResult just to reduce confusion?
I renamed the one in the wrapper to _formHistResult.
1) type \"b\" in the search field.
2) form history finds 1 entry (\"blah\"), search-suggestions finds \"baaa\", \"bloop\", \"bzzz\", the autocompete menu shows these in order with a divider between \"blah\" and \"baaa\".
3) type an \"l\" in the search field (\"bl\")
4) startHistorySearch()'s previous result contains [\"blah\", \"baaa\", \"bloop\", \"bzzz\"], Satchel filters this down to [\"blah\", \"bloop\"] to match the new \"bl\" search string
5) nsSearchSuggestions's onReadyState() change is called with updated search suggestions, builds up a new list of results, but sees that the form history result now has *two* entries.

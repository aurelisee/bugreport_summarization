from some time ago ctrl+c stops work
sleep 10 and press ctrl+c
so now i use ctrl+z; kill %1; fg
I get this with new konsole too, it works with some progs like strace, but not with others like ruby (which works fine in a vt).
Running trunk. Noticing this for some days.
Working around that by doing \"Ctrl-Z and kill %1\"...
The first revision where it happens is 760614:
That is only called at the end of the terminal session to kill the main shell process.
Otherwise Konsole doesn't touch any processes directly - it just sends the key presses you enter to the terminal.
Can you try changing the interrupt key sequence to something else and see if it makes any difference.
For example, change the interrupt key to Ctrl+Y
Then try strace, sleep, make etc. but use Ctrl+Y instead of Ctrl+C to kill them.
After changing /-\\C to be /-\\Y situation is the same for /-\\Y as it was for /-\\C:
To be sure which was making a difference, you'd need to:
The problem disappears for me with both 1 and 2, while changing the interrupt sequence has no effect just like Dmitry reported.
Fixed by SVN commit #771570.
\"Fix Ctrl+C not killing applications on some users' systems.
Reset all signal handlers to the default (SIG_DFL) in the child process after forking\"
Version:            (using Devel)
OS:                Linux
1.  Run \"konsole --nofork\" (without strace) and see if the problem is still there.
2.  Start Konsole normally (with no arguments), then attach to it with strace (using strace -ttt -p &amp;lt;pid of konsole>) and see if the problem is still there.

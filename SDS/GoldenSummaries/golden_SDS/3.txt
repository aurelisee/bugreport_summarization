I've noticed that I frequently trigger the rotate gesture accidentally, usually while scrolling.
The basic reasoning is that it's highly disruptive to be switched to another tab when you're not expecting it.
When it happens, you don't know what just happened until you notice that you're on some entirely different page, that's randomly to the left or right (1 or more tabs) from the page you thought you were on.
I'm don't think the rotate gesture for switching tabs is nearly as useful, discoverable, or a good fit as the other gestures are.
So, given this problem, we should just disable it for 3.5.
[I'd also be open to tweaking it to make it much harder to trigger accidentally, dunno if that's possible.]
I think I've never accidentally switched tab because of rotate gesture.
I've triggered zoom repeatedly too;
While playing with different browser.gesture.twist settings, I've found twisting through tabs often resulted in triggering a zoom.
The tab-switching gesture right now isn't obvious and feels unexpected when I hit it.
Since this is now implemented on Win7 with Multitouch screens please be sure not to disable it for Windows.
Fine by me; though I'd be a bit wary of having Windows users hit the same problem with multitouch trackpads...
So, I'd strongly lean towards only removing the rotate. Pinchy would've wanted it this way.
Can we get the patch reviewed - I think we want to remove the rotate gesture on both Windows and OSX.

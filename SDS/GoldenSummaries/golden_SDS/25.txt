While using Alt+Tab for switching between applications works fine in my KDE4 post RC1 version, when I try to use Alt+Shift+Tab shortcut the keyboard did not respond anymore and I don't know how to get it back.
However the mouse it is still working properlly, so I can logout with the mouse and I when I log back the keyboard it also works.
I just hit this bug as well.
This is really a serious problem.
It seems that if I hit Alt+Shift+tab directly I always get the problem.
In KDE 3, Alt+Shift+Tab is one of the possible shortcuts used for switching keyboard layouts (keyboard layout kcm -> xkb options -> layout switching tree item).
Even though I don't have that box ticked, it still persists in changing the layout with that shortcut.
While editing kglobalaccelsrc to change the shortcut does help, killing kxkb doesn't help at all and thus I don't think its kxkb causing the problem.
I confirm.
I had to reboot.
Note that the mouse was behaving has if the Shift key was pressed: it was extending the selection when clicking with the left button.
The problem is in KGlobalAccel, it doesn't release the grab when a shortcut is set that isn't triggered.
Which is the case for Alt+Shift+Tab, the shortcut that is actually send by X11 is Alt+Shift+Backtab.
Add a hotfix for Bug #153211, also ungrab the keyboard when Alt+Shift+Backtab was hit CCBUG:153211
Thanks, your hotfix fixed this problem, however on the past KrushDay someone mentioned a similar issue pressing Alt+PrintScr which is still present for me.
You can easily check wether its the same issue by doing the following:
Open $HOME/.kde4/share/config/kglobalshortcutsrc and find the action there.
Then open any shortcut dialog in any application and change one of the shortcuts.
When you're asked for pressing the new keyboard combination press the Alt+Print keys and check wether the label of the shortcut button is now the same as that in the rc-file.
If they differ its the same problem and that means we need a different fix for this problem, than the hotfix I comitted.
Ok  as far as I can see this is the same problem, namely that the keys Alt+Print don't produce the X11 keysequence that is expected.
In particular Alt+Shift+Tab creates a Qt key sequence of Alt+Shift+Backtab and seemingly Alt+Print creates Alt+Shift+Print in Qt key sequence.
So this is indeed the same problem.
Regarding the keys kcm: Thats \"expected\", the kcm hasn't been properly ported.
I've already posted a patch for a minimal port to the kde-core list.
I discovered another similar shortcut which is Ctrl+PrintScrn but this doesn't suffer this problem and works as expected.
To my knowledge, only Alt+Shift+Print and Alt+Print are triggered by this bug.
Since calling directly Xlib's XGrabKeyboard() is very unlikely and even probably undesired in kded, make KGlobalAccel again ungrab when there's no Qt caused grab.
I am running 4.2 beta 2 and this problem is still there.
I've found this bug in KDE 4.2 too.
I don't know if there is any specific key-combination that triggers it, but KWin acts as if I'm holding down the ALT-key, moving windows when I click and drag in them.

According to the javaDoc in Platform.getResourceString(Bundle,String), this method has been deprecated and one should use the NLS class or the BundleFinder.find().
The NLS class doesn't seem to provide me with the same functionality that Platform.getResourceString does, so I am assuming that BundleFinder would do the job that I need.
I don't think that replacement functionality was ever implemented.
As there are no current plans to act on them (and there has been no actions done in the last 2 years) I think we need to remove those comments - they make a rather confusing Javadoc.
The method Platform.getResourceString(Bundle,String) is not deprecated at this time;
the comments should have been added to the implementation code or to a bug report, not to the Javadoc of the Platform class.
Removed incorrect comments from the Platform class.

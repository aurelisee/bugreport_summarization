It would be usefull to add a \"Swap\" button to quickly change the aspect ratio between portrait and landscape.
This is needed when extracting a portrait from a landscape photo.
You already have to move the mouse to make your selection.
You'll likely do something that is approximately the right ratio.
If that's closer to portrait, then portrait should get used, otherwise landscape should get used.
That's one less button to press.
The point is being able to flip the aspect ratio after you have created your rectangle selection.
Sven is right, I meant that it would be usefull to have the swap option after the creation of the rectangle selection.
I've a landscape photo that contains an interesting flower for example.
I want to print a photo that have the same proportions as the original, but in a portrait format, more adapted to my flower.
I agree that Albert's idea makes sense.
Have gimp assume a landscape or portrait orientation automatically depending on whether the rectangular area swept out by the user is wider or higher.
Making this depend on the user's mouse action is not discoverable.
This is now implemented in trunk and seems to work reasonably well.
1. I first \"take a shhot of the aspect ratio\" by selecting all the original landscape photo.
2. I freeze the aspect ratio (with the appropriate checkbox)
3. I shrink the rectangle to permit him to be rotated by 90Â°
4. I \"rotate\" him by taking my calculator, and calculating 1/[aspect ratio], and putting it by hand
5. I've now a perfect portrait zone wich I can adapt freely to my flower; and I'm happy :)

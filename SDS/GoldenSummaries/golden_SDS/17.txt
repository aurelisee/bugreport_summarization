Currently apps use gnome_help functions to show help files, but gnome_help is part of the deprecated gnome_help

Patch adding gtk_show_uri and gtk_show_help to GTK+
The gtk_show_help function is missing |return ret;|.
You forgot to add the new funcs to gtk/gtk.symbols .
There is no \"Lesser GPL version 2\".
Somehow I feel that gtk_show_help() is too GNOME oriented to be included in this form.
I have been told that gtk_show_uri() will work nicely on the major supported platforms.
Updated patch. Adding ret and gtk symbols
Update your patch to remove gtk_show_help() to start with.
Patch removing gtk_show_help
gtk_show_uri allows a NULL parent, but that is not multi-head safe.
Having a GtkWidget *parent saves calling a gtk_widget_get_screen everytime you do a gtk_show_uri
I don't think the parent should be mandatory, because there are situations
A mandatory parent would be bad, as Ross explained in comment #11.
IMO the best solution is to change the function to take a GdkScreen instead of a parent widget.
Shouldn't hurt much to call gtk_widget_get_screen().
Updated gtk_show_uri patch now using a GdkScreen as input
- Wrt to the parent issue, I think the function should accept NULL there.
Being forced to call gdk_widget_get_screen() is annoyance, when  GdkAppLaunchContext handles unset screen already.
- The documentation needs to go in some more detail about what kind of 'uri' this function accepts.
- I'd be interested in a function that mounts the volume before opening it.
Updated patch. GdkScreen can be NULL
I've updated the patch with your first two comments.
We could add code that just tries to mount if this is necessary.
Matthias: being forced to call gdk_widget_get_screen is a good thing as it avoids multiscreen bugs.
Given that this is a 10-line function, it seems silly to make its interface less convenient for 99% of users just so it can cover an additional 0.01% of use cases.
Jaap: the way to handle mounting in GTK+ is to use a GtkMountOperation.
It is probably ok to commit it in this form now, we'll figure out the mounting later.
Thanks for the review. It's now committed

Converting it to a 1bit black&amp;white image should be a very fast operation (replacing 0 (8bit) by 0 (1bit) and replacing 255 (8bit) by 1 (1bit)), but it is not:
Indeed it is very slow, so I will confirm this bug report.
There is, however, a workaround.
I found with a little experimentation that if you use the \"Optimal Palette\" option for step 4.1, then the conversion occurs in a flash, literally a fraction of a second for me.
Image where to 1bit conversion is either slow or buggy (with GIMP 2.2.4)
However, the conversion was plainly wrong, it produced an image which was just black (the input image was nearly white).
Interesting -- clearly the generation of an optimal palette is not done correctly for this image.
Because this is a different issue, I am going to open a different bug report for it -- using your image as example, if you don't mind.
In any case, I've found a solution to the original problem, I think.
I found a very simple change that gives a major speedup when converting grayscale images to the mono palette.
Still just as slow for RGB images, though.
the 'optimal' palette finder does a first pass to see if there are already a suitable number of colours, and then knows that it can skip both the expensive quantization and dithering stages.
The 'mono' palette option doesn't even bother to start this pre-pass because it could only possibly pay off the extra effort if the entire image is pure black and pure white, which is expected to be a comparatively rare occurance.
1. Open a large grayscale image of your choice (e.g. larger than 2000*2000 pixels, maybe a scan result from your scanner)
2. Use \"Tools/Color Tools/Threshold\" to apply some threshold choosen arbitrarily.
3. Now you have a 8bit grayscale image, which actually consists only of color values \"0\" and color values \"255\".
4. Choose \"Image/Mode/Indexed...\", and there:
4.1 Colormap: \"Use black and white (1-bit) palette)\" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.2 Dithering: \"none\" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.3 Now hit \"OK\"
5. The conversion will work, but it will take many seconds.
1. Choose \"Image/Mode/Indexed...\", and there:
1.1 Colormap: optimal palette (wether 2 oder 256 colors, it does not matter)
1.2 Dithering: \"none\" (but I think it does not matter)

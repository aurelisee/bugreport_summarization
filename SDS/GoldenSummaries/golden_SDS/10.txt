Open a new image,
create a layer much bigger than the image, and with a different aspect ratio.
make a selection selecting only some parts of your drawing
use the channel mixer.
The selection looks wrong in the plugin, and the plugin can even crash.
This is due to the fact that the selection mask is taken with gimp_drawable_get_thumbnail_data () in the preview code.
Using any tool with preview give a one pixel (or less ;) ) preview instead of the good one.
Compute intersection between layer and active picture could be the solution...
As far as I can see, there are two reasonable options, and either of them will require a substantial amount of fixing in the aspect preview code and the plugins that use it.
It isn't clear to me which of them is better.
Bumping to 2.4 since this is not likely to get fixed for 2.2
It would help a lot if someone could attach an example XCF file to this bug report that shows the problem.
Doesn't channel mixer use GimpZoomPreview (not GimpAspectPreview)?
Seems like both GimpZoomPreview and GimpAspectPreview have problems when steps in reporter's comment are taken.
The source coordinates seem wrong to me and originate from gimp_zoom_preview_get_source_area(), but I have not yet tracked this down.
GimpZoomPreview handle layer offsets
This patch should fix GimpZoomPreview to handle layers with offsets with selections.
For GimpAspectPreview selection mask has to be applied for thumbnail of the whole drawable (selection can intersect partialy with drawable area).
Please commit this.

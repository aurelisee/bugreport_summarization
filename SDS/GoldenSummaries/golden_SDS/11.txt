When images are rescaled now the GIMP always defaults to linear scaling.
Sometimes I want to do a bunch of images with cubic scaling.
It would be handy that the scale dialog just remembered the last setting and always present that one.
The default interpolation routine can be choosen in the Preferences dialog.
I didn't know about the preferences setting until I saw this bug report.
This would clutter the interface even more.
Just always remembering the last setting is conceptually by far the easiest for new users.
I think a \"set as defaults\" button would clutter the UI.
This change remember the settings across dialog invocations.
Closing as FIXED.
(Please reopen if you strongly disagree, but please not without a non-ugly suggestion for a GUI)

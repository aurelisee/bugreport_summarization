I'm using the SWT library, ran the \"Hello World\" example:
and SWT fails to load, it always exits with java has exited due to signal 4 (SIGILL).
I see the window flash open, then immediately it crashes.
There is nothing in the logs.
I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11, so still on Tiger.
If you are launch from the command line, are you using the -XstartOnFirstThread option?
I'm running on leopard w/o any problems.
I tried running in Eclipse, from command line, and exporting a project as a runnable jar from Eclipse.
No crashes.
I just tried adding the -XstartOnFirstThread option and everything worked fine.
No crashing, everything is wonderful.

--> if i drag and drop a folder from a location to an other, cpu use for thunderbird process is more than 50%.
--> Even if the folder is empty
--> It occurs with subfolder move inside Local Folders
--> It occurs with folder move inside a pop account (for example moving Inbox->test to Draft->test
--> It DOESN'T occurs when moving a folder from a pop account to an other (for example moving AccoutA --> Inbox --> test to AccountB --> Inbox -->test ... Butin this case, by design, folder is copied, not moved --> it seems that this is
the delete which is the problem
- Memory doesn't change during the move time ... only a high level of cpu use
- Delete key or Right-click delete (so move to trash) got the same bad result
- Renaming a folder take a long time too
- Checking pop account take more resources than before ... 10 to 20\" of high cpu resource for checking mail, slowing a lot of windows applications
- Same thing for RSS folders ...
ohoh ... thus bug seems related to my 10000 temp files in temp folder: tmprules-xxx.dat
I've deleted all of them --> filters works again AND this bug seems solved by removing them
bad news: new tmprules begin to appairs ...
I guess the really low perf behaviour was coming that TB parsed all 10000 rules files for all received mail ...
same thing when moving a folder, it parsed the 10000 rules files to see if these have to be updated after the move
Resolved fixed as bug 375292 is fixed on branch 1.8 and trunk
Computer: Dell Latitude D820 laptop, Core 2 Duo 2GHz, 2Go Ram, 100Go HD 7200rpm
OS: Windows Vista Business
Thunderbird: TB nightly 2.0.0.10pre (2007111403) ... but problem occurs since long time

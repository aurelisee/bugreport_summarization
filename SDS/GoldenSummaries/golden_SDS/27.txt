In amarok2-svn I like the the new contextview , but I found the new bottom bar for managing applets annoying , as it covers parts of other applets sometimes , like lyrics one , so that you miss a part of it.
The real solution is to make it not cover applets, not make it appear/disappear on mouse over.
The toolbar should be like the panel in kde, it gets it's own area to draw in (a strut in window manager terms).
The applet should end where the toolbar begins.
Applets should not be larger than the viewable area, if there's an applet above it, then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint, and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen)
Basically, no applet should continue on off the screen, it should end at the panel.
You are reporting a bug on a non-completed feature ;)
will be fixed in 2.1.1, done locally.
I found it probably fixed in trunk :-)

the about:mozilla page in RC2 is right-aligned, but has LTR directionality instead of RTL.
perhaps the page should take CSS from intl.css, where localisers can override some of the classes or add a class to set direction.
Actually I would like not to add yet another entry in intl.css but to fix it in aboutMozilla.xhtml.
Same behavior also affect other internal about pages.
Pages that not translated, such as about:cache, about:credits and about:buildconfig should stay LTR.
the file dom/chrome/global.dtd control has direction control with the entity locale.dir.
the W3C prefers markup and not CSS:
To me, the trunk solution for this is to have a separate entity for each of those pages, to work around bugs like bug 427029.
Ideally we could just take this patch and not worry about having localizers update various different attributes based on
localization state, and just rely on them completing all the localization work to make it look decent.
Seems like we could just live with it not looking perfect for RTL locales that haven't localized it rather than adding complexity.
We could make that call per page, like in the case of the robots page, it might make sense to have an open window for not translating it, for neterror pages probably less.
Please get this landed on mozilla-central before getting approval for 1.9.0.x.
I'm not really sold on taking this given that it's more \"cosmetic\" than anything else...

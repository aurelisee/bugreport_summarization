after installation of Teneo the entry \"Ant Home Entries (Default)\" on the classpath page of Preferences->Ant->Runtime is empty (though the child entries of this tree node are visible).
In addition to this I get a lot of NullPointerExceptions in the .log with \"Malformed URL\" as Message when I open that preference page.
After each installation I looked at the that \"Ant Home Entries\" entry and all was fine.
But after installation of teneo it vanished.
After disabling of the teneo plugin the entry is visible again.
This seems strange behavior as installing teneo should not interfere with the rest of the eclipse installation.
Teneo is really just a set of plugins which do not change other plugins.
Can you remove .log file and then restart eclipse with the -clean option and then attach the resulting .log file to this bugzilla?
Can you also attach a screendump of the strange thing you see in preferences/ant?

Yes I can really not think on how this can be caused by Teneo.
I have moved the issue to the platform project.
Because of this I set set the resolution to fixed.

Using the current gvfs svn and nautilus 2.22.0, when doing a dnd from a directory on a proftpd server nautilus returns a file not available error.
It does the same when trying to delete the directory.
i get this too.
yup me too
We're getting this in openSUSE too, and it seems to happen with all kinds of FTP servers.
This is caused by broken backends.
Any attempts to open or copy/move a directory should fail with G_IO_ERROR_IS_DIRECTORY.
GIO functions and Nautilus rely on that.
Fix for gvfs-smb is now in trunk and gnome-2-22 branch.
Introducing new system of handling error 550 messages based on Benjamin's idea.
So far only simple check if the target is directory has been implemented.
Please review the patch, I especially don't like keeping references to GVfsBackendFtp and processed file in the FtpConnection object but it is the easiest way to do it.
My idea was that the error handlers should be implemented with simple ftp_connection_send() commands, that set errors automatically.
Commited slightly modified patch to trunk and stable 2.22 branch.
This fixes recursive copy of directory structure in Nautilus.
The delete issue reported in the first post might be related to bug #528347, where client apps using GIO/GVFS are unable see dot-files which are blocking directory removal as it's not empty.
Otherwise deleting whole directory structure works fine in Nautilus and backend reports G_IO_ERROR_NOT_EMPTY correctly.

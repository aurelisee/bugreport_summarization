Those will be minimal improvements like being able to resize the dialog.
We won't completely redesign the dialog e.g. to provide Firefox-like search unless it is contributed by a patch.
Here is few things to look at:
-- Ctrl-Backspace don't work in all text editor widgets (try fields in search dialog or text fields in plugin.xml editor)
-- support for seaching multiline text and alow to replace into multiline text
-- improve usability of search dialog.
Please file separate bug reports, e.g. we do not control the PDE editor - thanks.
The problem here is that JDT UI started to map the text editor's editing commands onto the text, combo and other widgets using TextFieldNavigationHandler.
It would be possible push parts of TextFieldNavigationHandler down to Platform Text to provide this for dialogs around the editor but I think this is a more general issue since users then also expect the navigation commands to work in
wizards, Ctrl+H search pages etc.
But this can't be adopted by JFace because they don't depend on the text editor plug-ins.
To solve this, JFace will have to adopt/define editing commands that can be used along with widgets and would have to provide the navigation handler(s).
Can you file a bug report against Platform UI and describe the problematic.
I would prefer if extensive hyperlink support is much lower (ideally at the StyledText widget but if not, at the JFace level).
UI Forms would like to port from FormText to StyledText.
StyledText has added many key features in 3.2 time frame with hyperlink support being the last one we need in order to port.
I'd like to throw in bug 145959 (forgive me if this doesn't apply to text editors):
On Windows, multi-line text boxes as used e.g. in the Run->Arguments dialog should support Return key in two ways:
[Return]: add CR/LF to current text box
[Ctrl-Return]: send Return key to parent dialog (similiar to executing the default action).

There seem to be some problems with the zoom out view.
It doesn't layout the activities properly.
Now only the newly added activity is shown, in the top left corner of the screen.
Now both the activities are shown, but not in the order they were added, and there is some whitespace around them.
If another activity is added, this happens again, and have to zoom in and out twice to get all 3 activities to show.
Just found out that the \"offset\" of the activity overview changes when you double click on the second activity.
The same probably happens too when adding an activity.
At this point, it's not possible anymore to use drag&amp;drop to move to the first activity.
Only zooming out, selecting the first, and zooming in fixes it.
Actually, dragging around the view does work here *except right after adding an activity*.
Bug = Add activity focuses view on the new activity until zoom level changes
I think add activity option (and zoom out) should be removed in the 4.1 final.
This bug is quite big, plus there's no clear way to delete an activity.
Also,performance when zoomed out is slow as hell.
performace is fine for me.
there are already people making use of multiple activities, we're not going to take that away from them.
we have gotten many reports of people who DO like it and are using it for day to day work.
when a new activity is added, don't move more than necessary to show it this seems to fix dragging the view around too :)
Version:            (using Devel)
OS:                Linux
1. Zoom out.
2. Add Activity.
3. Zoom in.
4. Zoom out.
1) adding/switching activity makes the view jump suddenly to another place (it's trying to make sure the activity is visible, and being stupid about it)
2) dragging the view around to see other activities no longer works (regression! it worked before woc)

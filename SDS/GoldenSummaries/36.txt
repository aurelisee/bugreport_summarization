When moving a large amount of files to my collection, amarok2 opens a file dialog for every single file that it moves.
Make a directory where you would like your music collection to be stored.
Go in to amarok2 and set it up so that the new collection area is included.
Then, right-click on local collection, select organise and select the new destination for the files.
Even my Core 2 Duo with 2 GB of RAM could not handle 16,000 file dialogs, and crashed my whole system hard, requiring a reboot.
Sorry, I can't reproduce this.
I have the following options ticked on in the Organise files option.
It might be that one of those options trigger this, or the combination.
Once I started messing around with what is ticked, the problem went away.
Now I am also unable to reproduce it.
I have been able to reliably reproduce the bug.
Use the files tab of amarok, then click on the directory that you want to move the files from, select move to collection.
Ignore \"the\" in artist names
Group by file type
Replace spaces with underscores restrict to ASCII
VFAT safe filenames
Overwrite destination
I still can't reproduce this.
I downloaded the source of amarok 1.94, and compiled it with gcc 4.2.3
Fix boolean logic which caused the progress info to be shown when overwriting tracks during a collection copy.
Version:            (using KDE 4.1.2)
Amarok version 1.94

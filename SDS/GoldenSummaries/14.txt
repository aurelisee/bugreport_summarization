When I try to export reports that contain graphs gnuCash just creates an empty html file.
Also it is not clear that the export can only do html files.
The first time I ran export I triped to save as .jpg and it created a html file named foo.jpg
In other words, you can only print the diagrams to postscript but not export them to HTML.
This is not going to change before the gnome2 port is completed, because we need to switch to a different graphical library before anything related to this can be changed.
We should be able to coax anything into giving us a PNG; GOG supports SVG export, too.
This shouldn't be tagged 'enhancement' anymore, but brought up higher.
It turns out that gtkhtml (at least the version I have on Ubuntu 9.04) doesn't support inline images.
The gnucash-1.8.x series is no longer developed.
We may keep this enhancement request as a reminder, though.
1. In gnuCash go on reports and create any report that contains a graph
2. In the report window click on Export
3. Save export to \"foo.html\"

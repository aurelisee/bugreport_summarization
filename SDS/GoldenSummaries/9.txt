Firefox currently supports a wide number of stand alone e-mail applications (including it's own Thunderbird client), when an e-mail link is clicked on in Firefox.
To the best of my knowledge it still does not support web based e-mail clients such as g-mail in this fashion.
The idea is that if one prefers to use a web based e-mail account, they should have the option to configure firefox to log into that web based e-mail account and open a compose new message window.
Webmail services can help give users programs that alter system mailto: behavior (e.g. the unofficial \"G-Mailto\" and the official \"Gmail Notifier\"), and Firefox users can download the WebmailCompose extension, but i think it would be better if this were an option in Firefox itself.

Is this not now fixed?
Indeed.

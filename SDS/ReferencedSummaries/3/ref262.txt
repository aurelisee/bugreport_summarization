Rotate gesture on multitouch trackpads causes cycling tabs in Firefox, but users might accidentally trigger it and get confused.
This gesture could be tweaked not to be triggered accidentally.
Also, pinching gesture causes zooming in/out, but since it is more natural there is no need to remove it.
Sometimes zooming in/out are mistaken for rotating or vice versa, but removing rotate gesture will resolve it.
Multitouch trackpads might not be an issue for Win7 users, but it is taken out from both versions anyway.Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090525 Minefield/3.6a1pre ID:20090525031110

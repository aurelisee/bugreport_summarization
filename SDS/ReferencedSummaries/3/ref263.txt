It is agreed that the rotate should be removed in Windows and OSX in the next version of Firefox.
It is suggested that the pinching gesture be removed as well, but it is decided that that should be in a separate thread.Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090525 Minefield/3.6a1pre ID:20090525031110

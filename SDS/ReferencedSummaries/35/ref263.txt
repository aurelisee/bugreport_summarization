There is a problem with the zoom out view which jumps around to focus on the new added activity and throws the rest out of focus.
Also adding a new activity makes drag and drop to move the view to other activities unusable.
Zooming in and the zooming out makes the last activity and the currently added activity visible.
For showing 3 added activities the processes of zooming in and out has to be repeated twice.
Also the order in which the activities is added is not maintained during this process along with the layout being messed up.
The offset of the activity overview changes when double clicked on the first activity.
The performance when zooming out has also been reported to be very slow for some users.
But at the same time people using nvidia have reported a decent performance.
The issue was resolved by making the view not move more than necessary to show the newly added activity, which also fixed the issue with dragging the view around.Version:            (using Devel)
OS:                Linux

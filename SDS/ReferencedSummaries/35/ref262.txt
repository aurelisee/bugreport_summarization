When a new activity is added, only the new activity is shown.
After rooming in then rooming out, both activities can be shown.
However, dragging around the old activity does not work, the place of the old activity jump to another place, and the place of the new activity seems arbitrary.
In addition, switching activity also makes the view jump suddenly to another place.
Since the operations of adding activity and rooming out are useful, the above problems should be solved.Version:            (using Devel)

Problems with the zoom out view were reported: adding activity focused view on the new activity until zoom level changed, and dragging around the view didn't work right after adding an activity.
Some people thought add activity option (and zoom out) should be removed in the 4.1 final, but other people didn't agree.
. One fix of dragging the view around was suggested.Version:            (using Devel)
OS:                Linux
1. Zoom out.
2. Add Activity.
3. Zoom in.
4. Zoom out.

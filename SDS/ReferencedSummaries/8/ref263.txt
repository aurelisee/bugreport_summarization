This bug talks about mismatch in implementation and it's specification in JavaDoc for IAdapterManager method computeClassOrder(Class).
Javadoc uses an example which does not catch the ambiguity very well.
A richer example is presented to realize that the search order in which classes and interfaces are returned does not match with the specification.
Specification in JavaDoc itself is a bit ambiguous.
There is a concern that changing implementation to match specification may lead to loss of backward compatibility.
This bug did not exist before February 20, 2004 and an accidental change lead to this issue, hence it was decided that implementation should be changed.
Implementation issue is then fixed and tested with richer example.
Minor changes to documentation make specification unambiguous.

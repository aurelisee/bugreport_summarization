The AdapterManager.computeClassOrder(Class) implementation does not match IAdapterManager JavaDoc.
At first it was suggested to change the spec to match the implementation.
But it was discovered that the implementation used to match the spec, and was accidentally changed during an update.
Since it was an accidental change, the fix is to change the implementation back to match the spec once again.
The JavaDoc was also changed to remove a contradiction and make the methods behaviour clearer.

When typing in the search box, sometimes suggestion entries are displayed above the divider, where the previous matching searches are displayed.
The problem is that nsSearchSuggestions.js is passing the SuggestAutoCompleteResult instead of the previous history search result, so entries from suggestions leak into history result.
A patch was added to fix this problem.
Further changes added to fix a problem with the patch.1) type \"b\" in the search field.
2) form history finds 1 entry (\"blah\"), search-suggestions finds \"baaa\", \"bloop\", \"bzzz\", the autocompete menu shows these in order with a divider between \"blah\" and \"baaa\".
3) type an \"l\" in the search field (\"bl\")
4) startHistorySearch()'s previous result contains [\"blah\", \"baaa\", \"bloop\", \"bzzz\"], Satchel filters this down to [\"blah\", \"bloop\"] to match the new \"bl\" search string
5) nsSearchSuggestions's onReadyState() change is called with updated search suggestions, builds up a new list of results, but sees that the form history result now has *two* entries.

A problem was noticed with the WIP patch from bug 469443 applied.
When typing in the search box, sometimes search-suggestion entries would be displayed above the divider.
The problem is nsSearchSuggestions.js is passing the SuggestAutoCompleteResult result, instead of it being the previous form history search result.
The bug wasn't visible before 469443, because nsFormFillController::StartSearch tries QI to provid result to nsIAutoCompleteSimpleResult.
The search-suggestion result is nsIAutoCompletResult now, so QI fails and Satchel is doing a new search everytime.
A fix was proposed, but wasn't quite right.
Satchel should be smarter about throwing away a previous result when the previous result's search string doesn't have a common prefix.
Another fix was proposed later, where the service's form history result copy is discarded when startSearch() is called with a null previous result.
There was a ._formHistoryResult in the SuggestAutoCompleteResult wrapper and also a ._formHistoryResult in SuggestAutoCompleteIt.
It was suggested to rename one of them to _fhResult.
The one in the wrapper was renamed to _formHistResult.
This bug was pushed http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/097598383614.1) type \"b\" in the search field.
2) form history finds 1 entry (\"blah\"), search-suggestions finds \"baaa\", \"bloop\", \"bzzz\", the autocompete menu shows these in order with a divider between \"blah\" and \"baaa\".
3) type an \"l\" in the search field (\"bl\")
4) startHistorySearch()'s previous result contains [\"blah\", \"baaa\", \"bloop\", \"bzzz\"], Satchel filters this down to [\"blah\", \"bloop\"] to match the new \"bl\" search string
5) nsSearchSuggestions's onReadyState() change is called with updated search suggestions, builds up a new list of results, but sees that the form history result now has *two* entries.

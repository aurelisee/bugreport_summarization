In GIMP version 2.2.x, converting an image from greyscale to black and white is very slow.
An 8bit greyscale image only consists of color values 0 and 255, so converting it to a black and white image should be a very fast operation, replacing 8bit values by 1bit values.
There is a workaround, where if you use the \\\"Optimal Palette option\\\" when selecting the \"colormap\", the conversion occurs in a fraction of a second.
A fix is committed that gives major speedup when converting greyscale to mono, but the problem still exists for RGB images.
This bug discovers the existence of another related bug, and there is a new bug report created for it.1. Open a large grayscale image of your choice (e.g. larger than 2000*2000 pixels, maybe a scan result from your scanner)
2. Use \"Tools/Color Tools/Threshold\" to apply some threshold choosen arbitrarily.
3. Now you have a 8bit grayscale image, which actually consists only of color values \"0\" and color values \"255\".
4. Choose \"Image/Mode/Indexed...\", and there:
4.1 Colormap: \"Use black and white (1-bit) palette)\" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.2 Dithering: \"none\" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.3 Now hit \"OK\"
5. The conversion will work, but it will take many seconds.

This thread is about a bug in GIMP(GNU Image Manipulation Program) that happens when trying to convert a grayscale image to a black and white image.
In this situation, the conversion will take a long time for big images, which is not acceptable due the fact that this conversion is just replacing each 8bit with 1bit
Continuing the thread, bug is confirmed but one workaround is suggested (by using Optimal Palette option) which turns out to be a wrong solution and lead to another bug thread.
The proposed fix for this bug is to treat the palette as gray rather than rgb which decreases run time by a factor of ten.
however this fix only works for grayscale images and rgb image conversion still takes a long time.1. Open a large grayscale image of your choice (e.g. larger than 2000*2000 pixels, maybe a scan result from your scanner)
2. Use \"Tools/Color Tools/Threshold\" to apply some threshold choosen arbitrarily.
3. Now you have a 8bit grayscale image, which actually consists only of color values \"0\" and color values \"255\".
4. Choose \"Image/Mode/Indexed...\", and there:
4.1 Colormap: \"Use black and white (1-bit) palette)\" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.2 Dithering: \"none\" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.3 Now hit \"OK\"
5. The conversion will work, but it will take many seconds.

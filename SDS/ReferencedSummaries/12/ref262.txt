Apply threshold is fast but converting is quite slow.
It is fast if ust the \"Optimal Palette\" option.
The converting with \"Optimal Palette\" option is fast but plainly wrong.
The \"plainly wrong\" issue is different.
A solution was figured out.
Patch codes.
New problem could appear.
The optimal palette does a first workround before determinating to skip both the expensive quantization and dithering stages.
The mono palette does not need to care about the pre-workround.
The \"mono\" operation is not rare.
A \"convert to 1bit\" operation would adjust the internal memory requirements.
GIMP's internal memory requirements could not be adjusted significantly.
OpenOffice's internal memory requirements could be affected.1. Open a large grayscale image of your choice (e.g. larger than 2000*2000 pixels, maybe a scan result from your scanner)
2. Use \"Tools/Color Tools/Threshold\" to apply some threshold choosen arbitrarily.
3. Now you have a 8bit grayscale image, which actually consists only of color values \"0\" and color values \"255\".
4. Choose \"Image/Mode/Indexed...\", and there:
4.1 Colormap: \"Use black and white (1-bit) palette)\" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.2 Dithering: \"none\" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.3 Now hit \"OK\"
5. The conversion will work, but it will take many seconds.

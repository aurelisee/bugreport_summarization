Firefox supported a lot of stand alone e-mail applications, but not web based e-mail clients.
The idea of providing an option to configure firefox to log into that web based e-mail account and open a compose new message window was suggested.
One solution to this was to ask Firefox users to download the WebmailCompose extension from webmail services, but it was preferred to have an option in Firefox.
The problem was fixed in a more recent version.User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12)Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (ax)

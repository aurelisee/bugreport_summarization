This is a suggested enhancement which will enable Firefox to support web based e-mail clients like gmail.
Clicking a mailto link is generally useless as most of the users use web based email application.
Other user programs and extension can possibly solve this problem, however Firefox itself should have this capability.
This behavior can also be extended to feeds.

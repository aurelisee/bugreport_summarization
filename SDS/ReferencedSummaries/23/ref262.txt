In Thunderbird, dragging and dropping a folder into another, or renaming a folder, causes the CPU usage to jump to over 50%, and takes more than a minute of processing.
The bug happens because there are more than 10000 files in the temp folder, called tmprules-xxx.dat.
It occurs because Thunderbird tries to parse all 10000 rules files to determine if they need to be updated after the file move.Computer: Dell Latitude D820 laptop, Core 2 Duo 2GHz, 2Go Ram, 100Go HD 7200rpm

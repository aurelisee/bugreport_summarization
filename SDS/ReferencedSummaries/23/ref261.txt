It takes a lot of CPU time to move a folder to another location in the same account when many tmprules-xxx.dat files exit in temp directory.
Deleting or renaming a folder cause the same problem.
In addition, it takes 10 to 20 percent more CPU time to check emails.
The problem can be temporally solved by deleting the 100,00 temp files in the temp folder.
However, the temp files will appear gradually and cause the same problem again.
In fact, the underline cause for this bug maybe the same as for bug 362539.

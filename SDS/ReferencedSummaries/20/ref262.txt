Teneo installation results in the the \"Ant Home Entries\" entry on the classpath page being empty, as well as generating NullPointerExceptions in the log file.
This is only seen when Teneo is installed and enabled.
This behavior is questioned, as there isn't an obvious way for Teneo to affect other plugins like that.
A set of log files, screen captures and other information is requested.
These are provided.
It remains mysterious how Teneo could be causing these problems, and the bug report's classification is changed.
The problem isn't seen with the new version of Teneo and the bug is closed.

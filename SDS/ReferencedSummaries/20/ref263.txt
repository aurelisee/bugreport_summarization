Installation of Teneo causes the entry \"Ant Home Entries(Default)\" to vanish from the preferences page.
Null pointer exceptions in the log file and \"Malformed URL\" error on opening preferences page also result.
A step by step clean installation of an eclipse environment shows that this problem occurs right after installation of Teneo where disabling Teneo restores things to normal.
A request for debug information like screendump and log file using a -clean switch is made to further investigate this problem.
The generated log files and related data did not lead to the reason behind this problem.
The issue was later resolved with a new release of Teneo which is believed to have done a consolidation of the used libraries.

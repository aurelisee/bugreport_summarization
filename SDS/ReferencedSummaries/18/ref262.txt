This thread is not actually about a bug and is just about a user who could not use SWT library in Mac OS X.
It is necessary to use -XstartOnFirstThread option when trying to use SWT library in OS X.
Here the user is ignorant of the fact that using this option is necessary, so he gets SIGILL error, the window crashes without anything in the logs.
After using this option, no error message is produced.java version \"1.5.0_13\"
I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11, so still on Tiger.

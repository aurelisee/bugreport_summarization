A user is trying to use the latest version of SWT library, but it even fails to run a simple example.
The Java compiler version seems to be OK.
It might be the way the application is launched on Tiger.
It turns out that he needs to add option -XstartOnFirstThread while running it in command line.java version \"1.5.0_13\"
I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11, so still on Tiger.

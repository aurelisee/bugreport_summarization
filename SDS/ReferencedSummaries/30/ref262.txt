An enhancement feature has been request here which swaps the aspect ratio of the selection box between landscape and potrait.
A different input scheme was suggested in which the user draws a selection box and depending on the dimensions it is snapped to either a landscape or potrait aspect ratio (Albert).
But since the aspect ratio swap was required by the reporter after the selection box has been drawn this idea wasn't carried forward although the idea seemed pertinent and useful.
For a swap button it was also suggested to use the first point of the selection box as a pivot for flipping.
Also it was suggested that initial aspect ratio could be set to that of the image.
A toggle button for setting the initial aspect ratio from the image, previous selection or the scheme suggested by Albert could be implemented.
However it was stated that making the output depend on user's mouse action is not discoverable and hence the user wouldn't be able to find out how to swap.

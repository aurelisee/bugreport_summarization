Some internal about pages in Firefox are hardcoded to be left-to-right, which causes some cosmetic problems in localized right-to-left versions of Firefox.
Adding an extra option in the CSS file is suggested.
However, fixing this in the markup language itself is more preferable.
The directionality of internal pages are suggested to be controlled by an option mentioned in the language packs, which might cause problems in some pages.
The problem is pushed to a higher level and left to be dealt with by localization authors after all.

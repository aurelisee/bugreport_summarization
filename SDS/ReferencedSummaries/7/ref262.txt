In localizations for languages that use RTL layout, the about:mozilla page is LTR.
Other internals about pages have the same problem.
The reason this bug has emerged is explained as being because about:mozilla has been moved out of the language pack.
A solution using dom/chrome/global.dtd is suggested.
A patch doing this is provided.
There is discussion of the best way to mark directionality.
It is suggested that a more global solution would be appropriate.
In response, the patch is defended assuming the localizers finish their work properly.
The case of about:robots is singled out as a special case that shouldn't be handled in this fix.
There are calls to get this patch approved for the 1.9.0.1 release.
Ownership of the approval is uncertain.

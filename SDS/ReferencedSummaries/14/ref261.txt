This is a defect in gnuCash which creates an empty html file while exporting reports with graphs.
The current graphical code relies on a library \"Guppi\" (it is no longer maintained), which can print graphs to postscript but cannot export them into HTML.
It was decided that bug should be kept as reminder for later release but the problem is not fixed until version 2.2.8.
The possible reason looks like gtkhtml doesn't support saving and even it's later version doesn't support inline images, hence fix is only possible using webkit.
In the suggested fix gnc-html-webkit pre-parses the HTML string to find &amp;lt;object&amp;gt; tag, calls GOG with the parameter values from the &amp;lt;object&amp;gt; to create a GdkPixbuf, then converts the pixels to png/base64 and embeds the HTML &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; in the original where &amp;lt;object&amp;gt; was.
Webkit also handles export by writing that HTML to file.
This fix is targeted for version 2.4.1. In gnuCash go on reports and create any report that contains a graph
2. In the report window click on Export
3. Save export to \"foo.html\"
I can confirm this using GnuCash 2.0.5 on Ubuntu 7.04, feisty fawn...and I can confirm that it's frustrating....

GnuCash does not export reports correctly - it always exports as HTML, regardless of the chosen output format, and leaves out images.
These problems existed due to limitations of Guppi, the graphical library used in this version of GnuCash.
Guppi is only capable of exporting images as PostScript files and does not embed them in HTML.
The newer gtkhtml has better HTML support, and webkit supports inline images.
This will be fixed in GnuCash version 2.4.1. In gnuCash go on reports and create any report that contains a graph
2. In the report window click on Export
3. Save export to \"foo.html\"
I can confirm this using GnuCash 2.0.5 on Ubuntu 7.04, feisty fawn...and I can confirm that it's frustrating....

The gnome_help functions which are currently being used are deprecated, so a patch is offered to switch to gtk_show_uri and gtk_show_help.
This is missing updates to a symbol table, has some licensing details wrong, and gtk_show_help doesn't work on all platforms.
Updates patches are given which fix these
It is pointed out that gtk_show_uri is not multi-head safe due to NULL parent.
It is suggested that it be forced to take a parent, but this is rejected.
Instead a version which takes GdkScreen is suggested and then provided.
It is suggested that GdkScreen should be able to be NULL and that the documentation should be improved, and this is accepted.
Auto-mounting is also requested.
Someone questions the utility of catering to so many special cases.
The patch is accepted.

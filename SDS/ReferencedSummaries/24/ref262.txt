This thread is about a bug in thunderbird mozilla which occurs when user wants to select multiple folders or mailboxes from the folders pane.
when user tries to select another folder by shift+click, previous selection is lost.
People have discussed on the importance of this feature for example its benefit for migrated users from outlook.
further in the thread it turns out that multiple selection is resolved, but dragging multiple items is not supported.
The suggestion for fixing the bug is to make some items enabled for multiple selections, among them are open, delete, compact, mark as read.
The bug is fixed by using the suggestion mentioned above, and also some other bugs are found in this thread which was handled by delevopers.User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050528 Firefox/1.0+

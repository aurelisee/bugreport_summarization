The folders pane in Thunderbird does not provide a usable implementation of multi select.
Multiple folders can be selected, but once these folders are \"used\" in some way (for example, they are all moved into a different folder), only one folder is actually moved.
This is confirmed by several others, and is highly desirable behaviour.
The proposed fix applies to many uses of multi select, and is fixed and marked resolved.User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050528 Firefox/1.0+

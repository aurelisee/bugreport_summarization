This is an enhancement request for Thunderbird email client so that user is able to select multiple folders using shift click and move them at once to another folder.
This is a highly desirable feature and is important for migrating heavy users over to Thunderbird from Outlook who have lots of folder to organize.
The functionality to select multiple folders is available on latest trunk but on 'drag and drop' only one folder is moved.
The proposed fix lists various possible options available on multiple select like- Get Messages, Open, Unsubscribe(for newsgroups), Delete(it is decided that option to delete would be disabled for multiple select because of some technical difficulties), Mark folder/newsgroup read.
Some more related issues are also listed like-delete on newsgroup to unsubscribe was broken, save search wasn't enabled for news and tools menu folder commands.
Proposed changes are approved and bug is fixed.User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050528 Firefox/1.0+

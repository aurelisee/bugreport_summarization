It is suggested to save the last setting used for image scaling so a user doesn't have to change it every time.
It is then suggested that this behavior should apply to other dialog options, otherwise users would have to discover the default setting in the preferences.
This enhancement is applied, as adding \"save as default\" buttons in dialogs would add clutter.

When rescaling images in GIMP, the interpolation method is not saved from last time it was invoked, which causes inconvenience particularly when users want to repeat rescaling many times.
The default method can be chosen in preferences dialog, but it might be hard to find or inconvenient to access.
A \"save last setting\" option in the dialog box is suggested but declined because of making a mess in UI.
Finally, the last method used is automatically saved and defaulted in the next usage.

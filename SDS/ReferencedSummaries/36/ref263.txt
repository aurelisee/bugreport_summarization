When using Amarok to move files into a music collection, a file dialog is opened for every file, which in this case was 16,000 file, and crashed the machine.
There was trouble reproducing the bug, until it is figured out that the \"Overwrite destination\" option was causing the bug.
The faulty logic that caused this bug is now fixed.Version:            (using KDE 4.1.2)
Amarok version 1.94
Make a directory where you would like your music collection to be stored.
Go in to amarok2 and set it up so that the new collection area is included.
Then, right-click on local collection, select organise and select the new destination for the files.

Find callers of functions does not work properly.
Problem reported in ver 2.1.3.
Suggest to upgrade to ver 3.
KDE3 can open KDE2 projects and both of them can run on the same PC.
FTP to download KDE3
KDE3 is good and wait for stable ver.
Issue still exists.
Expected feature is similar to Find Usage in IntelliJ IDEA.
Highlight Usage is in wishlist.
Suggested behaviour.
Function Call Tree view is in wishlist
The feature is not clever enough.
Highlight of usage of variables has been implemented in KDE4.Version:            (using KDE KDE 3.1KDE 1.2)

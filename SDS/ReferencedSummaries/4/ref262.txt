An error occurs where two file/folder creation operations that depend on each other are executed.
The file system structure changes, invalidating the second operation, even though it is conceptually a valid operation.
It was impractical to change this behavior, so the API was changed to check the validity of an operation, and the documentation is updated to clarify.

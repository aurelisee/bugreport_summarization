The method FolderDescription#createExistentResourceFromHandle(IResource,IProgressMonitor) does not create members that rely on the creation of other members not initially present.
Initial suggestion is that createExistentResourceFromHandle should instead check to see if members of a FolderDescription should be created.
Note that this is only a problem if code is structured inappropriately, and fixing it would require tracking changes to the file system that are outside the scope of the current class design.
Javadoc was updated to clarify that the existing class does not track these changes, and additional validity tests were added.

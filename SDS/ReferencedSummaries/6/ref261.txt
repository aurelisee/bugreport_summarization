This report is about an incorrect deprecation comment in javaDoc for platform.getResourceString(Bundle,String).
JavaDoc suggests using NLS or BundleFinder.find() instead of platform.getResourceString.
Functionality of Platform.getResourceString is never implemented in any other class which is inconsistent with javaDoc.
and many adopters are still using it.
It turns out that javaDoc is incorrect and in fact Platform.getResourceString is not deprecated, and incorrect comments are fixed.

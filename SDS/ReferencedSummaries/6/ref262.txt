The JavaDoc for Platform.getResourceString(Bundle,String) states that the method has been deprecated.
It is confirmed that the method is not deprecated, and that the comments should have been added to the implementation code or to a bug report, not to the JavaDoc of the Platform class.
The fix is to remove the comments from the Platform class.

A bunch of comments in the javaDoc have never been acted upon.
As a result, some classes and functions in the javaDoc have never been implemented.
In addition, the classes which are assumed to be dropped are in fact not deprecated.
Therefore, the comments in javaDoc should be removed to prevent confusion.
The removing of these comments has been added to a milestone.
In fact, this bug is a duplicate to another bug (247983).

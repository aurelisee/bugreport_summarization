There are two similar entries â€œScreen Shotâ€ and â€œScreenshotâ€ in the file menu in a development version of GIMP.
In addition, when users choose â€œScreen Shotâ€, there is no option to â€œSelect a Region to Grabâ€.
However, when the â€œScreenshotâ€ is selected, a dialogue box will show the option of \"Select a Region to Grab\".
Although the option exists, the real functionality has never been implemented at all because of the short of volunteers.
Some other software such as Winsnap and IIRC Tor can be used to select a region to grab.
Finally a plug-in is added to fix the problems.1. Launch GIMP 2.3.11 Development for Windows on a Windows 2000 platform.
2. Got o File->Acquire->Screenshot.  (Note the two different entries for \"Screen Shot\" and \"Screenshot\".)
3. Tick \"Select a Region to Grab.\"
4.  Set the delay.
5.  Click \"Grab.\"

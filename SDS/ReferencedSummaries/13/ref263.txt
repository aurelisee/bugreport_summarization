In the development build of GIMP 2.3.11, the screenshot functionality is incomplete on the windows platform.
It is expected that the option to \"Select a Region to Grab\" grabs a certain region of the screen, but instead it takes a screenshot of the whole screen.
This is a known issue, and it is stated that the development version has incomplete and broken features, and the user should be using the stable release.
It is impossible to implement the look and feel of the X11 screenshot plug-in on the Windows platform, instead Winsnap is used.1. Launch GIMP 2.3.11 Development for Windows on a Windows 2000 platform.
2. Got o File->Acquire->Screenshot.  (Note the two different entries for \"Screen Shot\" and \"Screenshot\".)
3. Tick \"Select a Region to Grab.\"
4.  Set the delay.
5.  Click \"Grab.\"

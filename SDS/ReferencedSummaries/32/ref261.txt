This is an enhancement request for making a separate window for history in Firefox and not relying on sidebar(ctrl-h).
There is some disagreement about need for this enhancement.
A suggestion is made to make an about page for history similar to about:config, which can complement the sidebar and a new separate history window would probably be an overkill.
\"chrome://browser/content/history/history-panel.xul\" can also be used to show history information in a separate window.
There is another request to make history more detailed for example providing information like title, location &amp; last visited and also making this functionality as easily accessible as sidebar.
A general observation is made that Mozilla history page was better and Firefox does not support a decent history functionality.
However, there is an extension to Firefox(EHM, Enhanced History Manager) that solves the problem nicely.User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7b)Gecko/20040316

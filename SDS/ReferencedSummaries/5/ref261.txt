This is a suggestion for enhancement so that lines added in a patch can be counted during \"Apply Patch\" wizard.
Regular expressions which counts lines starting with '+' is preferred and simplest approach to achieve this.
Same approach can also be extended to lines removed just by replacing '+' by '-' in the regular expression.
As the first fix tried, user can specify the regular expression on the preference page and it is empty by default.
This solves the problem but does not work out of the box.
So another fix is tried which does not require that a regular expression is provided, however user can specify his/her own regular expression on the preference page.
On testing it was realized that this also counts empty lines and a suggestion was made that output should also specify non-empty lines as filtered output like-\"Patch contains 207 added and 29 removed lines (151 / 27 filtered)\".
The default behavior is simple and user has a choice to make changes to regular expression to achieve more sophisticated output(for example it ignores empty lines).
This fixes the current issue and a more sophisticated default behavior is not required.
Filter idea is good but it should be dealt as a separate bug.

Automatic testing have been failing for the most recent builds, probably due to crashes in BrowserTests.
A patch is offered which changes resource pools so they are only released when their device count goes to zero.
The patch is pushed back for the next release candidate as it hasn't been tested properly.
A simpler patch is offered, which checks the pool validity.
The automated testing system is set to start performing the tests which were crashing it again.

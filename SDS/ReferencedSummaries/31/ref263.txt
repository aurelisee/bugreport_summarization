An enhancement request for adding support for text-editor improvements in selecting, spell checking, searching and hyperlinking text has been made.
A suggestion for improving the current search/replace dialog has also been made.
Few improvements which can be made have been pointed out like Ctrl-Backspace doesn't work in all editors, searching multiline text etc.
The problem of Ctrl-Backspace not working in all editors was reported to be solvable by pushing the behaviour of TextFieldNavigationHandler down to Platform Text.
since JFace doesn't depend on text editor plug-ins it can't adopt those.
Also a request for making the support for hyperlink much lower was made because UI Forms would like to port from Formtext to StyledText bearing in mind the keyfeatures additions in StyledText.
Also support for Return key in 2 ways for multiline textboxes like Run-Arguments has been made to handle adding CR/LF to the current text box and to send return key to the parent dialog.
The request bug was marked as fixed with a new version release.

A bug appeared in Konsole such that using ctrl+c does not break the current command.
Many other users reproduce this bug, except for it not affecting a few application.
The problem is gone when running with the --nofork command, or attaching to strace.
The bug is then fixed.Version:            (using Devel)
OS:                Linux
sleep 10 and press ctrl+c
so now i use ctrl+z; kill %1; fg
1.  Run \"konsole --nofork\" (without strace) and see if the problem is still there.
2.  Start Konsole normally (with no arguments), then attach to it with strace (using strace -ttt -p &amp;lt;pid of konsole>) and see if the problem is still there.

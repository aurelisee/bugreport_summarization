Pressing Control+C from within the KDE 2.1 Konsole doesn't terminate the process.
This issue was fixed by resetting all signal handlers to the default (SIG_DFL) in the child process after forking, SVN commit #771570.Version:            (using Devel)
OS:                Linux
sleep 10 and press ctrl+c
so now i use ctrl+z; kill %1; fg
1.  Run \"konsole --nofork\" (without strace) and see if the problem is still there.
2.  Start Konsole normally (with no arguments), then attach to it with strace (using strace -ttt -p &amp;lt;pid of konsole>) and see if the problem is still there.

An initial request for hiding the contact network icons in Kopete was made as to the reporter it didn't matter and was causing unnecessary clutter.
Another person made a request for an opposite setting in which the contacts are sorted by their networks.
It was suggested that a customization using CSS could be provided.
It was also pointed out that KHTML widget could be used for the customization.
It was then suggested that many people might be interested in showing the contact networks and if there's enough demand then an option to disable it can be implemented.
A fix was made in trunk where the user can define the list layout and also icons can be hidden if required.Version:           0.9.0 (using KDE 3.3.0, Gentoo)

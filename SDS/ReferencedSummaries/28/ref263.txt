This is an enhancement request related to Kopete which will allow user to turn off displaying irc icon next to the display name.
There is another request to allow removing KopeteStatusIcon from the contact list details and a more general solution would be to allow CSS customization of the contact list.
This functionality can be achieved without any technical hurdles by rendering the list view inside a KHTML widget but it may not be done before KDE 3.4.
Contact list code is flexible enough to allow addition of a drag-and-drop style editor for this change.
The change is finally made so that a user can define contact list layout to hide/show an icon or change order.Version:           0.9.0 (using KDE 3.3.0, Gentoo)
Compiler:          gcc version 3.3.3 20040412 (Gentoo Linux 3.3.3-r6, ssp-3.3.2-2, pie-8.7.6)
OS:                Linux (i686) release 2.6.8-gentoo-r3

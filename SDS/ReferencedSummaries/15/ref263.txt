Using gvfs svn and nautilis 2.22.0, copying or deleting a directory leads to a file not available error.
This is confirmed by several others, it also occurs in openSUSE with all kinds of FTP servers.
The cause is determined to be because of broken backends.
Any attempts to open, copy or move a directory should fail with G_IO_ERROR_IS_DIRECTORY, because GIO functions and Nautilus rely on it.
The fix is committed, and some changes are made to the implementation before the bug is marked resolved.

An accessibility concern is raised as both Window-Eyes and JAWS seem to fail to read out the title of groups of radio buttons and other controls.
A work-around in Window-Eyes is provided, and specific examples of the failure are listed.
Further testing with various versions of JAWS does not show this problem.
A stand-alone example applet is given to demonstrate the problem, but again it cannot be reproduced by others.
The JAWS configuration files are compared.
Finally, the problem is shown to be specific to JAWS on Windows XP with a specific Java environment.
This is resolved in the new version 6.0 of JAWS.I am using JAWS 5.1.383.

JAWS and Window-Eyes do not show group titles in some UI dialogs (where groups have a single child without a name).
Search and find/replace dialogs are introduced as two test cases.
Controls could be read again when they get focus or their windows have just got opened.
The problem is not seen by some other people.
Therefore, they install a fresh version of the software.
However, users get different outcomes from fresh versions (both perfect and erroneous).
Finally, it turns out that this problem only happens in Win XP when Win2K modules are mistakenly being used.I am using JAWS 5.1.383.

Some screen reading software is not able to read the group title for controls in dialog boxes.
This bug is not reproducible by everyone, and it is determined it only affects WinXP users who have javaw.exe.manifest in jre/bin, as this causes different controls to be used.
The problem is fixed in JAWS 6.0.I am using JAWS 5.1.383.

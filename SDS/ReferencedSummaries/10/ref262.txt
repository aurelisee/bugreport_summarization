If the layer and image have different size, the plug-ins GimpZoomPreview and GimpAspectPreview will fail and can even crash.
The bug is hard to fix because some APIs should be changed accordingly.
Therefore, although this bug is sever, a patch was designed four years after the bug report.
After installing the patch, the area displayed in preview is the intersection between layer and the selected part of an image.
For GimpAspectPreview, the selection mask should be applied to the thumbnail of the whole drawable.Open a new image,
create a layer much bigger than the image, and with a different aspect ratio.
draw something on the drawable (using some colors)
make a selection selecting only some parts of your drawing
use the channel mixer.

There seems to be an error in the selection mask size assignment when layer size is greater than image size which can cause the plugin to crash.
Intersection of the layer and the active image has been proposed as a solution.
Aspect preview code is suggested to be changed by either displaying the entire drawable or just the selection.
The fix's milestone is set to 2.4 as it was a crash and should have been resolved before 2.4 release if possible.
An example was requested and the same was attached.
It was pointed out that channel mixer uses GimpZoomPreview and not GimpAspectPreview &amp; that both had problems when repro of the reporter is followed.
Selection mask was found to have width larger than the actual mask in the preview code in the example image.
A patch was created which handles layers with offsets and displays area which is the intersection of active area and selection.
Selection mask has to be applied for the whole drawable for GimpAspectPreview.
A request to commit the patch was made.
A suggestion to commit was made.
The fix was then committed.Open a new image,
create a layer much bigger than the image, and with a different aspect ratio.
draw something on the drawable (using some colors)
make a selection selecting only some parts of your drawing
use the channel mixer.

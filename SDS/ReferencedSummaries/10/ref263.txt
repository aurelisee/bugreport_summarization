When an image and a layer have different sizes, plugins can crash because the thumbnails are based on one size only.
It is suggested that the intersection between the sizes could be used, or limiting the area appropriately.
The problem is bumped several times.
An example XCF file is requested and provided to demonstrate the problem.
The problem extends to GimpZoomPreview as well as GimpAspectPreview.
Work is done to track down where the exact error occurs.
A patch is provided which lets GimpZoomPreview handle the layer offsets properly.
This is accepted to be committed in the trunk.Open a new image,
create a layer much bigger than the image, and with a different aspect ratio.
draw something on the drawable (using some colors)
make a selection selecting only some parts of your drawing
use the channel mixer.

This report is about a bug in KDE which occurs when user presses Alt+shift+tab for switching between keyboard layouts.
After pressing this key combination keyboard does not respond any more.
It turns out that the problem is in KGlobalAccel which doesn't release the grab when a shortcut is set that isn't triggered and a hot fix is provided to solve the problem.
Finally users claim the same bug for combination of alt+printScr which is also fixed by developers.

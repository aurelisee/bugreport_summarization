When using shortcut CTRL+I to align codes, the line below will always move right for Kate.
But sometimes, we expect the line below moves left to align this line with the above line.
However, Kate does not have this feature.
To move the line below left, one can select the â€˜Unindentâ€™ or â€˜Clean Indentationâ€™ options.
This feature do exist in CVS.
In CVS, lines are aligned according to normal C/C++ styles.
At last, empty lines are ignored when align documents since the empty lines may introduce many useless leading spaces or make the alignment of documents very slow.Version:            (using KDE Devel)

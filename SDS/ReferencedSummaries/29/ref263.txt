A bug for indentation was filed which was later reported to be a new feature rather than a bug.
The report was made about out of indentation phrases which should be aligned with the line above it rather than the positive indentation scheme followed by kate.
The requested behaviour was that of align section in which the entire section selected gets aligned with respect to itself.
A suggestion to try using 'Clean Indentation' was made for aligning misaligned blocks.
This requirement was then found to be present in the cvs which did the alignment of the current line or the selected text using normal c/c++ conventions.
It was found to work for expression in parenthesis but for arguments it was found to work with limited correctness.
A suggestion to open another wishlist was made if this was a problem.
It was pointed out that if there's no text in a line then it's not aligned which was later reported to be a feature.Version:            (using KDE Devel)

This is a defect related to code indentation in Kate.
Current line of text is not align as expected in the code on pressing ctrl-i and all it does is moves to the next tab stop.
It is later clarified that Kate always inserts positive indent to a line on ctrl-i rather than formatting the code, so it is an expected behavior.
However, this functionality of formatting code is available in CVS which aligns code(current line or block of text) in right formatting for C/C++ on pressing CTRL+TAB.
It is tested if it shows same behavior on an example as it does on emacs.
It works almost perfectly apart from some deviations like- closing parenthesis are not aligned with the opening one and this can be filed as a new enhancement request.
It also does not work on empty lines which is intentional because it would leave useless leading space and also make formatting slower for the whole document.Version:            (using KDE Devel)

The bottom bar for managing applets sometimes covers the applets, obscuring the bottom part.
Some think it could be only displaying on mouseover, but it is decided applets should never be drawn underneath.
This bug is caused by the incomplete feature of resizing applets, and will be fixed when that feature is completed.
A few months later the bug is fixed.version:           svn (using Devel)
OS:                Linux

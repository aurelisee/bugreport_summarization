This a defect related to GUI of Amarok music player which bottom bar for managing player covers parts of other applets sometimes.
A suggestion is made that it should appear/disappear on mouse over, however the real solution would be to make it not cover applet.
Bottom bar should be like panel in KDE which does not cover a window by default and applet should not be larger than viewing area whether it is resizable or not.
In other words, there should be not part of applet which is inaccessible.
There was some discussion debating whether this is a defect or non-completed feature.
The bug is finally fixed.version:           svn (using Devel)
OS:                Linux

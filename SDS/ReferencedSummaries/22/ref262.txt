This report is about a bug in lightning which is a application developed by Mozilla.
This bug occurs when a subscribed calendar in lightning is deleted from the server.
As a result, in this situation lightning gets stuck in an infinite loop using 100% of CPU, despite the fact that server has sent 404 error.
The expected result in this situation is to stop sending requests when 404 error is received.
For resolving this bug, after realizing that there exists many connections to the server at the same time, it turns out that the bug is happening when a method named safeRefresh() is called.
This bug is fixed after the developers add a condition to safeRefresh() function which check for error 404 and if this error is found, no refresh is done.User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; fr-FR; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Iceweasel/2.0.0.13 (Debian-2.0.0.13-1)

Struct fields are required for the functionality of a widget as the latest PyGtk wrappers access data members directly and hence C programmers would require to access them too.
These struct fields should never be required and hence this is a bug which must be removed by implementing accessor functions.
Some of the listed data members which are accessed in the PyGtk wrappers directly already have accessor functions while some of them are for deprecated widgets.
The rest require accessor functions.
Added to API fix for a future milestone but a higher level for the API is requested as GtkList widget is already deprecated which is required for accessing functionality of the Combo widget.
Combo box is already broken in GTK-- where a different implementation for the list is used which makes it impossible to access list data.
Hence a suggestion to make the combo a GList is made which would make working with it easier while allowing access to list items.
It is not sure if a good way of handling arbitrary widgets with associated text exists without some sort of ListItem.
The ongoing gseal work is handling the issues described above.

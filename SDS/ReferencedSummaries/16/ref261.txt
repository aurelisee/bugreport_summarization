Possibly from a previous discussion, it was concluded that if struct field is needed for using any widget it should be reported as a bug.
This bug report lists 43 examples where this general rule is violated.
It was observed that some of these already have accessor functions or occur for deprecated widgets but some of these still need a fix.
A suggestion is made that API should be raised to a bit higher level for example to avoid deprecated GtkList to affect Combobox widget.
Another suggestion is made to replace list in Combobox with GList.
The ongoing work on gseal finally fixes this bug.

It is pointed out that some PyGtk wrappers are directly accessing widget data attributes, which shouldn't be needed.
A list of 43 examples is provided.
Some already have accessor functions, and some are for deprecated widgets.
It is suggested that accessor functions be of a higher level, deprecating the existing lower level ones.
Applications are already going to break due to deprecated widgets, which has already become a problem for other wrappers.
A  suggestion is made that access list items as a GList would make everything more usable.
The entire problem is handled by a separate development team much later.

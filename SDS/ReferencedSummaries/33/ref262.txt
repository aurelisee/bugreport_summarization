When one uses the file browser to navigate to a song in the collection and select â€œmove to collectionâ€, and at the same time ensure that the new file name is the same as the old file name, the song is renamed to itself, then deleted.
The cause of this bug is that CollectionLocation removes the source files after the copying operation.
An patch is added to prevent this problem by making sure that the source and destination are different before moving and removing files.Version:           svn (using Devel)

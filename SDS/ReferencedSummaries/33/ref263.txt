If a song is moved from a file browser to a song collection where one with a same name exists then the song gets deleted.
A patch was made which checks for the song to be present in the collection before removing it after the move operation but was found to be incorrect.
Another patch was then made which checks for the KURLs to be identical before copying which was later modified to include cleaned URLs.
It was pointed out that problem with same src and dest wasn't the one which was causing this behavior but it's that since the file is being moved from a file browser, a special code which checks source collection doesn't get called.
It was then pointed out by the initial patch maker that the removal code is never called and it's moving a file to itself which is deleting the file.
slotJobFinished is not called in the current form which results in slotCopyOperationFinished in not being called and hence removal code in not being called.
A patch was then created where slotCopyOperationFinished is called when there are no jobs created which resolved the problem.Version:           svn (using Devel)

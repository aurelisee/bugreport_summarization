A bug was reported that using the file browser, a file when copying or moving it onto itself was deleted.
A patch for this was provided, but it was incorrect.
A semi correct patch tried to compare the KURLs are identical before attempting to copy.
The workflow of how the removing happened was discussed.
Another bug was raised that slotCopyOperationFinished gets called independently of slotJobFinished.
A patch was created to fix these problems.Version:           svn (using Devel)
Compiler:          gcc 4.3.2 gentoo
OS:                Linux

Add three basic Telemetry support to Thunderbird.
This patch adds three news fields to telemetry.h, fixes a couple comments, and makes the error code more meaningful in one case. 
comments,it might be worth adding another flag,use a unit of messages per 10secs. 
suggestions about the patch,change the method to return rv,change the method to mozilla. 
the real concern and improvement,give new patch.
so the only worker that bumps the _indexedmessagecount is the folder-message-indexer, and there s an if that says if we didn t index any message, don t add a probe which answers the concern.

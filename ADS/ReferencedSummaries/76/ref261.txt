removing tracks from list, one of which is playing. 
I cannot trigger this crash on purpose. The trace looks fine anyways.
 I haven't been able to reproduce this with 0.9.1cvs from today.
Marking this FIXED.steps to reproduce: 1. select artist
play a song
2. select all tracks, one of which is currently being played
3. right-click and remove from playlist

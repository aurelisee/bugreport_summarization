A path is requested for regarding a JVM lock threading problem caused by two threads. Exact details for this problem and stacktrace are asked. After thoroughly observing the stacktrace it is found that the problem is caused by a lock acquired by FacetedProject.modify() while ProjectFacetsManager.create() needs a lock at the same time in an adaptar code. A solution to remove it from start is proposed and the severity of bug is reduced. This is revealed as a right solution and applied by releasing thread before refresh, thus released for 3.0 m6 release.

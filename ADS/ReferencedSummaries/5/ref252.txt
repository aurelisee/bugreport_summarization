There is a deadlock at the FacetedProjectFramework when trying to change the runtime caused by two threads. A dump snippet is created, so the stack trace of both threads can be reproduced. This is a common problem, facetedprojectframeworkimpl holds the lock while calling refresh, so the problem occur. The fix is modify facetedprojectframeworkimpl.create method so that the list is no longer hold. The patch will released in the 3.0 code stream.

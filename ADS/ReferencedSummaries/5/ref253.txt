in an adopter product, while executing tests scenarios using 3.0m5, we found the following jvm lock which seems to be caused by two threads accessing some faceted framework code, and we need a patch for base on m5 code for this defect. The reason is that you are generally discouraged from doing anything in plugin ' s start method that can block or try to acquire a lock, that is, the projects are still locked during change notification, any delegating facet or runtime changed operation will be locked out. A simple solution here might be to spin off a thread from the start method instead, modify facetedprojectframeworkimpl.create() method so that the projects list is not held while the project refresh is called. Release the fix into the 3.0 m6 code stream.

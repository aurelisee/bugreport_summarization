There raise a problem that in gwenview 1.4.1 when selecting the zoom option fit to window it doesn t work on an image that is smaller to the image window size, while it works in the other situations. 
We have to wait for kde4.1 where we can enlarge small images when auto zoom is activated.version: 1.4.1 (using kde kde 3.5.5)
compiler: gcc version 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (debian 4.1.1-20)
os: linux

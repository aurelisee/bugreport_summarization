There is one problem that when i call mysqlcatalogdatabase.refresh(), the single schema held by the database is not refreshed. The mysqlcatalogdatabase flags ' schemasloaded ' and ' catalogsloaded ' are never set to boolean.true. When the flag 'schemasloaded' is set to boolean.false in refresh(), but the schemas are still loaded.. There are two ways to resolve the problem, one is to create an attachment(id=145871) possible patch to fix the setting of the flags accordingly whereas this has to get pushed to "future" beacuse we just don't have the manpower, and the other is to commit the fix with an added modification on super.refresh().

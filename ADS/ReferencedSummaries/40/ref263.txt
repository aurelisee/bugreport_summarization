the problem is sending a messages are not indexed.
The fake header is wrongly indexed. 
this problem is related with other id.
Protz thinks this may fix bug 534449. 
jonathan give the sequences after and before fix and suggestion. 
the new patch says that msgkeychanged should not try to do anything smart if gloda hasn t indexed the fake header yet. 
new phenomenon, restart gets them indexed and restart gets them indexed. 
Andrew said that,ideally, we would like to augment the existing unit test for msgkeychanged in gloda to make sure we don t handle messages that have not been indexed. 
David's attachment can fix protz and gloda is seeing msgsclassified for the fake header, which means it is indexed instantly.

"Error while trying to send email. 
There were problems" and "E-mail successfully sent" notifications appear together while sending an email and afterwards the email lost. 
It is noticed that the other issue is more sent-mail and malformed address - centric. 
and proposed patch fixed the issue.0) start kmail-mobile
1) open composer ( write new mail )
2) open action flap->configure transport
3) press delete for every transport
4) add recipient, enter subject and text for the mail
5) press send

The usage of the fuzz factor is always confused, even thougt what it means and what is it for. A testcase is created to show that tht fuzz factor doesn't work and the testcase is useful and easy to test. A patch is proposed, but it has limitation and need more discussion obout the default maximun fuzz factor and how to match context lines. The patch need good set of tests to test the function and there are some discussion about the how to find the possible match,the maximum fuzz, the explaination and the additional context lines. After discussion, the result is infor the user the maximum value, apply the fuzz factor th any context, some line can be skipped to the right lines. After all the discussion is determined, a final patch is created and varified.

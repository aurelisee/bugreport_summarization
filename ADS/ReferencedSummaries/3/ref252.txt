The bug as a hotbug point out that there is a runtime compatibility problem between WTP 1.5.x and 2.0.1. In WTP 1.5.x, when target the project to a runtime, it is given a different id and name, when you import it into WTP 2.0.1, it will not be able to resolve the runtime becasue it can be identified by id, not name. The solution is allow a callback to the bridge to return a different kind of id during the comparision. One is to allow for alternate facet runtime names ander the covers, and the other is check for a migrated name. the safe way is the logic can be placed in the code that read the faceted project metadata file. the patch is released the 2.0.1 and 3.0 streams.due to the changes in bug# 137825, projects created in wtp 1.5.x don ' t have a runtime facet attached when brought into wtp 2.0.1 in wtp 1.5.x, create a project and target it to a runtime created using the api

There is a problem that projects created in wtp 1.5.x don ' t have a different runtime facet attached when brought into wtp 2.0.1. One idea is supporting the new runtimes(id based) and the old runtimes(name based). But konstantin think that we can ' t have it both ways, not sure what we can do,and tim tells him what he has done is not right enough. Creating an attachment (id=77141) proposed patch v2.0 give konstantin an good idea to solve the problem.due to the changes in bug# 137825, projects created in wtp 1.5.x don ' t have a runtime facet attached when brought into wtp 2.0.1 in wtp 1.5.x, create a project and target it to a runtime created using the api

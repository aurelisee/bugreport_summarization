Due to changes in bug 137825 the projects from WTP 1.5 are moved to WTP 2.0.1 because the id and name created at runtime are different thus marked as a hot bug. One way to solve the issue is to allow a call between old and new runtime which generates different ids during comparison. It was asked to elaborate the proposed changes in more detail. The impact on framework of such changes are discussed. Later it is realized that this problem will cause failure in migration. Thus, a simple solution by checking the providing an alternate name for a runtime mapping from old to new and opposite is proposed. A new patch was requested. Instead of solving the backward compatibility a safer new idea of placing the code at the point where the facet file is read, proposed. The changed code was tested and released.due to the changes in bug# 137825, projects created in wtp 1.5.x don ' t have a runtime facet attached when brought into wtp 2.0.1 in wtp 1.5.x, create a project and target it to a runtime created using the api

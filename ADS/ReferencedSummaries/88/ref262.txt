The problem is that the online/offline icons are done in the old gnome style and doesn t match the rest of the icons in the interface. 
Someone raise priority as there is patch and ui freeze is near. 
It looks that put gtk in 32x32 have a good reasult. 
If you want this for 2.24,just commit to trunk.

The online/offline icons are done in the old gnome style and doesn't match the rest of the icons in the interface. 
New online and offline icons + svg sources. 
I raise priority as there is patch and UI freeze is near. 
Even mclasen isn't sure, but he thinks GTK should preserve the aspect ratio if we put it in 32x32. 
I'll try it and see if I can get it to work. 
I think I would just replace the old bitmap with this one for 2.24 and look for a better solution in the next cycle. Here's a complete patch. 
I put the images into 32x32 and GTK found the icon names alright. 
I want this for 2.24, but it may require screenshot updates from our beloved docs team.
Committed to trunk (revision 35995).

Digikam configure script misleading, it should reports too old rather than libraries missing. Nothing can be done for this, because of the pkgconfig macro from cmake. 
To fix it, kde could switch to the new cmake pkgconfig wrapper.version: 1.3.0 (using kde 4.4.4)
os: linux
steps to reproduce: compile digikam 1.3.0

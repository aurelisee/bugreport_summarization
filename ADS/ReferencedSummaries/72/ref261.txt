Digikam 1.3.0 depends upon unreleased versions of libraries libkexiv2 and libkdcraw. 
When the configure script does not find the version of the libraries it needs, it reports the libraries missing, in stead of too old. 
The pkgconfig macro from cmake simply says whether it has found a suitable version or not wasn't sufficient. 
To keep things simple as well,It would be better for the pkgconfig wrapper to be used in KDE.version: 1.3.0 (using kde 4.4.4)
os: linux
steps to reproduce: compile digikam 1.3.0

Seahorse creshed when click a ssh-key and delete, the segmentation fault. 
Some stack trace and running status is reported. 
this bug should be fixed this one commit. 
Even though the cresh does not occur anymore, the hehaviour is not as expected.1. open seahorse
2. right-mouse-click a ssh-key and select delete
3. crash

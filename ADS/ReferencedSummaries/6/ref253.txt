The problem is that i can't use a new targeted runtime in the webproject creation wizard,that is, when creating a new webproject, i created a new runtime but i was unable to see in the drop down the newly created runtime, i then created a second one, i was then able to see the first one, but not the second newly created runtime. The attachment (id=86250) patch v1 and bug 214375 (they are interconnected) appear to fix the issues, which still needs further testing/review before being released.0. ensure you don ' t have any installed server (runtimes) defined
1. open the create new dynamyc web project wizard
2. enter the name for the web project
3. using the target runtime " new " button, create a new runtime
4. the runtime should be displayed in the combobox, but is not there
i was using tomcat 5.5

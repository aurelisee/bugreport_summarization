Even after two updates Help->Check For Updates doesn't find anything but comments says it is fixed, seems to affect windows. 
Apparently, it is related to other bug and it might resolve itself after nightly builds because there are two updates with same ID. 
Further testing and nightly builds fixed this issue so it is fixed and verified.

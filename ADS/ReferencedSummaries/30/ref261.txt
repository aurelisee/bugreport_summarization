The wrong version of flash is shipped with Tegra therefore it showed be changed by a safer version, also, it didn't warn about the Nvidia QuickTime plugin which is wrong too.
Device trial is underway and some warnings should be added in case if problem arises or a polite error message.
all these issues are tested, verified and released for Beta 2.

Thunderbird tabmail does not honor onbeforeunload event handlers. 
We should offer tab types a chance to refuse being closed. 
This patch need test because it has bug. 
Changing the way the tab close fixed the patch bug.- open a gmail content tab, - compose a new message, - type some text in the message body, - close the tab

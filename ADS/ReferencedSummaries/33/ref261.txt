While submitting the form after CCing itself the duplication warning prompt appears asking for reporter addition confirmation which shouldn't appear. 
It is a regression and if you are not the part of the group it won't allow you to edit the bug. The first version of patch makes some changes with $self->check($dup_id), set_dup_id() and new() which confuses the spaces, to resolve this issue. Second patch checks visibility, dependson and checking the dupe by making certain changes in check() and _check_dup_id() methods to test this bug- also removed || to resolve id not found error.

The comment in the in the javadoc for IAdapterManager.computeClassOrder(class) does not match it's implementation. In the javadoc also have contradiction, whether the superclass is first or the superinterface is first. The question is the patch should prefer the comment or the implementation. For the contradiction, some people think should use breadth-first search and delete the wrong comment. For the unmatching, some people think should stick with the implementation and chenge the specification. A deep learning will study why the specification is changed that way. At last, the specification is changed right and have no contradiction. And the specification is more accurate. The implementation is also changed to the right way.

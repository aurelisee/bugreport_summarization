When I use 362 to change the bug#297039 in my environment,there is a problem. There is a solution that solve this problem and have a good reasult on 3.7 and 3.6.2. But this solution can not work well in my computer when using m20110210-1200. Changing the definition of entrypath to be based on entry.getpath() can solve this problem. Making a comlete patch with new tests ,there is a good reasult. However, there may be some problem that has not been reported so far. Creating attachment 198834 patch for 3.7.1 and appling patch + tests to head can solve these problem.
version: 3.6.2

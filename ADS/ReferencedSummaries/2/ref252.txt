When debugging to inspect the code, the java file is open instead of the class file, so can't inspect the content of the 'this' variable. Showing the class file or the java file from the archive does not affect the inspect action. The reason is that when a root exists the previous version JDT would return a PackageFragementRootSourceContainer, but in 362 doesn't exist. There is a change in the code, to detect it,the definition of entryPath should be check. Much more smoke testing is need to test the patch. Although the patch is created, it need more time to test and to find something like unwanted side effects. So the patch is for 3.7.1.
version: 3.6.2

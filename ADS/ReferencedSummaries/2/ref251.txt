A regression error from old bug fix about inspection of 'this' of class file was found when the code is debugged and java file is open under a specific scenario. The scenario works fine on 3.6.2 and 3.7 releases. On further inspection it was revealed that the problem was a regression of old fix and only produced when selecting the editor because it finds the wrong path. The changes were reverted and fixed and there were no issue, it is also added as a fix in 3.7.1 release.version: 3.6.2

at the thunderbird-stdlib project for collection of jsms,there are some problems should be solved.Jonathan need some suggestion. 
jonathan add a middle-ground solution which can allows jsms to know which URI they're being imported from.He also give his reasons. 
bsmedberg give some problems.
Does this work with..paths, or does that confuse the xpconnect module cache. jonathan answered the problems and give a new attachment.
so it looks like the xpconnect module cache is not confused when i use a..path, but there s no reason why it should. 
A.sel. feel uncertain and jonathan give the answer.
why is this in xpcomutils.jsm and not implemented as components.utils.importrelative or even better implemented in cu.import itself to differ between urls and relative paths?

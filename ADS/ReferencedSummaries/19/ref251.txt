The functionality of fully qualify duplicates is wrong, the name is confusing as it conflicts with the purpose - suggested name could be Show status line. The fully qualified duplicates checks the unique name with full container path and unchecks qualified name. It is suggested to change the name to Show Status Line as it doesn't fulfil what the name suggests, hence, the name is changed and verified.

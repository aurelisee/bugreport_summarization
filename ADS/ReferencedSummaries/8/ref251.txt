The information from Add Attachment modal dialog can't be retrieved. The user can't make any changes during attachment, disabling the UI. The reason for having modal dialog is explained because having a non-modal dialogs, useful at few places, make UI confusing. The alternate solutions for this problem are addressed i.e. either making it a non-modal or offline support for attachments or changing the UI. It is suggested to use the combination of two and three as a best solution but for time being first solution could be tried. It is eclipse community decision to use wizards as modals because for average users the modal is easier to use thus, it is not advised to break the rules unless there is very valid reason to do so. It is suggested to get rid of the modality issues to resolve this problem. If the parent shell is correctly set, this problem won't occur as in gtk. It is agreed that the rules shouldn't be broken but there are exceptional cases and even in the case of non-modal dialog if the UI and workflow will remain the same, users will not find any difference. It is suggested that the pop behind solution will resolve this modality problem...it worked fine on windows. It is suggested that the UI should be reviewed and another patch is in process where this solution could be tested well. It is decided to compromise on this solution for a while but have to find some long run solution that wouldn't violate the conventions. It is also suggested to make it a sandbox feature and add some tweaks like SWT tweaks. A summary of possible problems with this approach are asked for. The non-modal dialog is made and page refresh is called when changes are saved, in case of error it pops up. Only JIRA module uses this approach others will be ported to new release.

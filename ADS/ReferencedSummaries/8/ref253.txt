The reason why the dialog is modal is to stop user from changing/submitting from editor while adding attachment, that is, editor should be 'disabled ' during attachment (bug#171135) but ui not blocked. It could be easier to write comments to patch having access to ui. The eclipse sdk has made a deliberate decision to make wizard dialogs modal, since they require a sequence of user input, so it is bad to break platform conventions, and i prefer that both ctrl+h and the attachment wizard were non-modal. The way it works on gtk which is different from on windows that if the parent shell is correctly set to the workbench window the wizard dialog should not never get hidden behind it. I would like to aim for a solution that does not violate the platform conventions (comment #6) and enables a richer user experience (e.g. spell checking for attachment comments), given the benefits i think it 's an acceptable compromise to make the dialog non-modal for now.

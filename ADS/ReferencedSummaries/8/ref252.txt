The "Add Attachment" dialog is modal, so when open it, any information from Eclipse can not get, this is to stop user from changing or submitting from editor. There is a discussion on whether the dialog is modal or non-modal. some think that the dialog should be non-modal,because people can make use of other resource. There are some solutions to address it, directly making the dialog non-dialog, adding offline support for attachments and use a different UI. But other people think it shuold be modal, because Eclipse SDK has made it a deliberate decision, the proble is in the modality of the interaction, not the shell. A non-modal patch is proposed, and has been decoupled from the editor.

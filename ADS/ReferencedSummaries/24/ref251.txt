R3_5_maintenance branch is broken as it contains additional changes; version increase not suggested. The manifest, build notes and Binary Outputstream changes are rolledback, we need to agree upon these and other required changes and we also need to make some more versioning. All bundle and apts are not checked completely and version number problem is not that serious but in same cases change in manifest files might lower the version number.

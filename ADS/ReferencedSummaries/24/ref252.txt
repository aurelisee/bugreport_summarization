R3_5_maintenance branch is always in inconsistent state. The branch looks strange and it looks it got created off head. When roll back to detect, there is anything else, to replace the old plugins, version dance is need. the branch change may never went in the branch, so the bug is produced. Some experiment should be learned from the bug, the buanch should be simply. The SDK has the rule to branch, so everyone should follow the rule, otherwise will make mistake.

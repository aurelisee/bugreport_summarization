the problem is that select "save to disk" for pdf,not downloaded or saved. 
After discuss,Jim think the problem is that "in the new userdownloadsdirectory code i've made the assumption it ' s a path". 
He think "should be getting the complex value as an nsilocalfile instead.". 
for the patch v.1,tested on windows,works great.
But it show different error on mac. 
Gavin give some suggestions.
He think this patch does fix the problem,but need to remove the dead code. 
Jim give the new patch.
Gavin think that is not good and should go with the firt patch but just additionally remove the second " if(bres)" check. 
Jim give the v.3 which be tested.

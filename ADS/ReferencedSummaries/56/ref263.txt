When closing the composer while a mail composed did not have a recipient, the draft would lost. Till fixed the bug, but some other bug came out, Sabin made another bug report. 
Volker fixed the bug, and it is corrected now.after clicking on ok in the pop up dialogue asking the user to specify a recipient the composer closes and the email is lost instead of saved as draft
this seems incoherent with the save as draft functionality that i tested today and which works fine
- launch kmail mobile
- click on write new email button
- after entering a subject and a few words, open the actions tab and click on save as draft
- a no recipients found - kmail mobile pop up dialogue opens with the following message you should specify at least one recipient for this message
- click on ok
- the user can open the actions tab and specify the recipient s email
- and then click on send the email is properly save as a draft and stored in the draft folder

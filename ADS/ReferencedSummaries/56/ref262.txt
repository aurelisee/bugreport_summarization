The mail can not be saved as draft without specifying a recipient. 
The draft is lost if no recipient is specified. 
The problem is fixed.after clicking on ok in the pop up dialogue asking the user to specify a recipient the composer closes and the email is lost instead of saved as draft
this seems incoherent with the save as draft functionality that i tested today and which works fine
- launch kmail mobile
- click on write new email button
- after entering a subject and a few words, open the actions tab and click on save as draft
- a no recipients found - kmail mobile pop up dialogue opens with the following message you should specify at least one recipient for this message
- click on ok
- the user can open the actions tab and specify the recipient s email
- and then click on send the email is properly save as a draft and stored in the draft folder

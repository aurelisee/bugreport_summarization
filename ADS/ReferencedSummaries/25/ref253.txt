when typing in the search box, sometimes search-suggestion entries would be displayed above the divider. 
the problem here is that nssearchsuggestions.js is passing the wrong previousresult to form history. 
Patch v.1 was created, but was not quite correct. 
Patch v.2 was created, fixed the problem. 
The name was changed to _formhistresult.1) type " b " in the search field
2) form history finds 1 entry ( " blah " ), search-suggestions finds " baaa " , " bloop " , " bzzz " , the autocompete menu shows these in order with a divider between " blah " and " baaa "
3) type an " l " in the search field ( " bl " )
4) starthistorysearch() ' s previous result contains [ " blah " , " baaa " , " bloop " , " bzzz " ], satchel filters this down to [ " blah " , " bloop " ] to match the new " bl " search string
5) nssearchsuggestions ' s onreadystate() change is called with updated search suggestions, builds up a new list of results, but sees that the form history result now has *two* entries.

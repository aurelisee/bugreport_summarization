On doing Alt + Arrow crashes while using on Gmail Compose Window, appearing also on textareas/inputs as well, appearing both on linux and windows. 
The problem is detected with the space in the compose window which seems invisible space when cursor from the left side, via pressing right-arrow also no respect for space, pressing left-arrow and right-arrow keys will skip right over the invisible space.
This crash appears later too and wordbreaker, fixed and checked in.

When using alt+arrow to move the cursor around word-by-word in text boxes, it always crashes in the gmail compose window. 
The bug crashes not only windows specific but also linux. 
The space is there while we're not showing it and the arrow keys don't seem to respect the space.
When coming at the invisible space from the left side or the following line, via pressing arrows, it can't reach the right position. 
When double-clicking the first word in the sentence it will crash.

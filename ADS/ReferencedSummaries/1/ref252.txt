The javadoc deprecation comments is incorrect, according to it, the Platform.getResourceString(Bundle,String) is deprecated, and use NLS or BundleFinder.find() instead. But the NLS class doesn't provide the same functionality, and the BundleFinder class can't be find. So there are some comments should be removed from the javadoc th make it correct. Actually the Platform.getResourceString method isn't deprecated, there are other methods make the same function. There is another bug is a duplicate of this.

The problem is that user can not find the bundlefinder class whose functionality can not be used . One solution is given that we should add bunch of comments like that to the platform ver. 1.92,and we need to remove incorrect comments from the platform class. There is a problem that wtp has a code that uses this method. the solution is not quite right because The comments should have been added to the implementation code or to a bug report, not to the javadoc of the platform class. You can also move the comments to internalplatform and deprecate platform applicationrunning().

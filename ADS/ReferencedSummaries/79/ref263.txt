Gimp should use libgimpprint to print instead of using a outdated print plug-in. 
The code is changed, using g_malloc and g_free instead of molloc and free in all the place. Fixing this bug will bring some advantages, for example adding new printers and so on. 
The branch depends on libgimpprint, need more time to do the change. 
After some translation, the bug will be fixed.

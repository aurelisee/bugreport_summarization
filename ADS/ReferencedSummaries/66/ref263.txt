Viewing multiple jpg images in tabs will slow down konqueror. 
This is because konq redraw all the tabs when open another. 
After the images are loaded, the performance is normal again. 
The bug closed since it was not an issue in 3.5.version: 4.0 (using kde 3.1.9)
compiler: gcc version 3.2.3
os: linux (i686) release 2.4.22-ck2

When switch to another compare editor, the file is not automatically selected in the synchronize view, and two feature were wanted to be seen. Patch v01 was created that add linking when sync'ed using workspace model, but still missing somethings. Patch v02 was created, sync view "show in" target available in synchronize perspective. A button in view-toolbar would be useful. Patch v03 was created, this is an updated version of the patch that ready to be committed, however, there are still some bug not fixed. Patch v04 was created adding some function on v03. Patch v05 fixed all the bugs, and works great.

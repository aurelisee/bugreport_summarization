As a feature request, in the synchronize view the file is not automatically selected. Two features are need to be added, the first is add 'Show In' and the second is 'Link with Editor'. When switch to the other compare editor, the selected files can also be selected. Both compare and non-compare editors are include the selected files. Patch is created to fix it, but there are somethings still missing. As the limited scope, a toolbar button is insteaded by a view menu. But there are some people disagree with it because they use button frequently. Some command ID must be used for the ToggleLinkAction. After some improvement, the patch is verified.

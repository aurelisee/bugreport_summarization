It is suggested to show the synchronized view and link with editor features as sometimes the selected files are not shown when switched to compare editor - further verification was asked for it. A new patch linking synchronized view is done but lacking IShowInTarget, IFile.class and Java Workspace sync for instance, are yet to be implemented. The Link with Editor is only enabled for non-modal views because of limited scope and after some discussion it is decided to add a button on a toolbar for synchronization.

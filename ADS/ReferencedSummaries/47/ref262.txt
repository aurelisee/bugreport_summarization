A bug was intially created as a clone of bug 472411 to make it impossible to use the talos reports to effectively determine and slow down. 
There is an idea that when the set up was under load there were some idle talos machine bug they were hidden. 
If these idle talos machine were hidden which can be resolved through the tinderbox admin page bug the results can not be avaliable for us either because of a bug. 
But no matter how many talos boxes the tree has it will still skip builds by design. 
We can check if we have any machines set up that can be deployed to by checking the count of machines for each project branch.

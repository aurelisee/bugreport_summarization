I'm requesting that additional talos hardware be deployed to triple the bandwidth available to tracemonkey talos on at least windows and mac, as soon as it can be acquired. 
there were, however, three talos boxes that had been marked as hidden on the waterfall and were not being displayed. 
this set up was under load over the weekend, mostly, i believe, when we were trying to track down talos crashes and so forth by bisecting our changeset history. 
if they ' ve been hidden it can be resolved through the tinderbox admin page - unfortunately, there ' s a bug in tinderbox wherein if machines have fallen off the waterfall due to idle time they are sometimes re-added as hidden when they do their new report. 
file a bug under webtools tinderbox, bug 390349, but had a credibility problem. 
talos does skip builds, but at the moment not by design - see bug 457885. 
if this bug is now about inappropriate skipping of builds it should be duped to the active ftppoller failures bug. 
I've added text to the top of each tinderbox waterfalls for mozilla-central, mozilla-1.9.1 and tracemonkey giving a count of machines for each project branch.

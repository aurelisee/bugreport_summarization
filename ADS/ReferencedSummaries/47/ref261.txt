The tracemonkey talos need additional computing power to triple the bandwidth. 
The bug should be fixed as soon as possible, to catch beta3 and rc1 schedules. 
Over the weekend, the set up is under load. 
There are bugs in the tinderbox server if the machine fall off the waterfall because of the idle time. 
No matter how many talos boxes the tree has, it will skip build by design. 
A patch is created, text are added to each of tinderbox waterfalls, for each branch, tracemonkey give a count of machines. 
The branch for buildbot is update, and if a poll finds many directories, it will only look at the newest one. 
The patch is created and verified.

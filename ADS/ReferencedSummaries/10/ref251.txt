Two rest operation are requested for fixing a bug: status should return a file information and its difference. Some tips for solving both problems are given like using DiffCommand in JGit API and a decorator resource. It is decided to stick at JGit classes. In a discussion later it is decided to use the REST api for difference part and besides it there are some other things to be added. Another question about getting status to become part of Git API asked and if the bug related to it is posted or not and work status. It is requested to put a bug about status command and meanwhile the first part of the patch was uploaded and it is suggested to start moving to work on other related issues. An additional REST API to add some new features like indexing, add, reset and commit. A rough version is released and some naming conventions are set.

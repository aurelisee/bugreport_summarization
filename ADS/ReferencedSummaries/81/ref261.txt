In the gimp module we have multiple text domains and maintain multiple po directories. 
In each of these, 'intltool-update -m' detects a long list of files that are missing from POTFILES.in. 
We would like to fix this. 
The gnome-games module is also annoyed by this bug. 
allowing directory to be skipped could be a good thing to add for intltool. 
Fixed in SVN trunk. 
You can now ignore directories by simply placing the directory name in POTFILES.skip. 
We are now using this feature in gimp trunk. 
Seems to work nicely with intltool 0.40.0.

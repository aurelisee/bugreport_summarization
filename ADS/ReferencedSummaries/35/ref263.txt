To fix bug 327208,additional cnames need to be added to start.mozilla.com. 
this needs coordination from marketing first as they need to verify that the correct destination domains exist at yahoo/google first. 
the main issue is that we need to ensure that yahoo is set up to handle ja-jpm.start.mozilla.com pointing to ja-jp.mozilla.search.yahoo.com. 
Mike suggest that why don't we just point ja-jpm.start.mozilla.com at virtual-redirect.mozilla.org, and then redirect from there to ja-jp.start.mozilla.com. 
Mike allocate taskes,push this zone file except for ja-jpm,do the same redirect hack as done in 1.5 for the mac,don't force the extra latency on japan users. 
Justin suggest that we need to get the yahoo vhosts setup correctly (for ja-jp-mac and ja-jpm) so we can move both of these off virtual-redirect and to cnames in parallel. 
The problem is resolved.Working on http://ja-jpm.start.mozilla.com to get supported.

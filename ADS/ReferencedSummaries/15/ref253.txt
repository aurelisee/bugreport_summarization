There raises a problem that when creating a sequence on my postgresql database then query for it via org.eclipse.datatools.modelbase.sql.schema.schema#getsequences() only an empty collection is returned. One solution is to under the help of some patches for better pstgres support. However,the patch file itself doesn't have any indication inside it as to whilc projects the patch changes apply, so it is better to create the patch for one plugin at a time and indicate which plugin it applies to. Create a local branch "bug359861" for these changes and merge it into the local master branch, and then push everything to the remote repository, or make the changes got into the local master branch in other ways.

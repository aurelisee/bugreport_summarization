problem,when update form nightly,the new build doesn't apply even running updater.app by hand.After restart,the update archive gets deleted. 
mike find the update applies *once*, and then subsequent updates do not get applied and list the steps to reproduce and find the problematic file active-update.xml. 
About active-update.xml, darin find,although it can update,the file still in directory after he update.
And which can't be moved. 
Gary find that using the auto update feature has been working on alternate days.
Actually,the file is downloaded to update.mar. 
Darin noticed that the updates/0/ folder contained a copy of updater.app.when he deleted the entire updates/ folder, the problem went away, and he was able to update. 
The fault is ,under other systems (linux and windows), updates/0/updater.app is not a directory.
the solution is probably to change nsupdateservice.js to pass |true| to the nsifile::remove method.OS X 10.4.2 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b4)Gecko/20050730 Firefox/1.0+

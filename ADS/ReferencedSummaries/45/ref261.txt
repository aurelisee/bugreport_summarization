On the mac system, when update fetches, it doesn't apply anting, even by manually. 
It unknow the bug is caused by the server or the other thing. 
The other platform is fixed, except the mac system. 
Active-update.xml is supposed be be deleted from the system, but it retained and the contant is different in windows and mac. 
Directly remove the active-update.xml doesn't work. 
Auto update feature sometime work but sometime unwork. 
Two updater.app may influence the result, After the folder is removed, the problem resolved. 
A patch is created and pass the verification and test.OS X 10.4.2 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b4)Gecko/20050730 Firefox/1.0+

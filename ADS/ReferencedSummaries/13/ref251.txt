A problem in Dali framework is detected, apparently all files at same locations, on runtime IProject.getAdapter(ProjectResourceLocator.class) returns null with the first call but not with subsequent calls. Some consider this not to be an expected behaviour but some race conditions thus, some stdout testing is required to figure it out. Further testing revealed that this problem is caused by the factoryLoaded' flag which is set to true before being accessed by other thread in a proxy. During the start up, many dali projects are built concurrently, end up calling multiple threads which 50-70% results in failure. A proposed solution patch is uploaded which sets factoryLoaded flag in finally block and synchronized, thus, it is double checked. The path contribution complies with the coo of eclipse.

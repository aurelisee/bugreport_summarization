The adapter factory is not invoked by the platform adapter manager that a call to iproect.getadapter(projectresourcelocator.class) will return null with the first call but not null with subsequent calls, However, the adatpter factory is implemented in such a way that it will never return null. There raise problems that how we can investigate, sans the debugger and why the platform adapter manager does not invoke the appropriate adapter factory. It may be possible to reference a class from the plugin providing the adapter before-hand, and adopt the debugging technique that stdout messages in plugin startup, factory in stantiation, and adapter look up to start with. The reason why null being returned for an adapter factory has not been loaded is that factoryloaded can be set to true and accessed by another thread as true before the actual factory has been assigned in the proxy. Since we cannot rely on the synchronized loadfactory(...) method to prevent a race condition in relation to the factoryloaded flag, so one proposed solution is to attach a patch that solves the issue by changing when the factoryloaded flag is set to true.

Platform.getAdaper will return null for the first call, but not the following call. It happens in each start up, but not under debugger, so this is an unexpected hehavior. This is caused by the race condition where bundle is not active while the adapter request come. The root is the AdapterFactoryProxy and the flag of 'factoryloader'. Given the details of the bug occur, the solution is to change the 'factoryloader' flag true, and the behavior should stay the same. The caller method is synchronized, but the callee method is not, so we can't relay on this to prevent race condition.

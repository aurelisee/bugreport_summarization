branch_20090126_localdiff is there any particular reason why we validate patch root provided manually in the create local diff wizard, while only existing paths are accepted, which doesn ' t allow us to ignore leading path segments which was. we should allow to continue even using a path to a location outside the workspace or paths like " local history, in such cases i would expect a warning/info in the wizard header though. The attachment (id=130229) fix v02 with changes can fix some of the issues and another bug with patch_v1.

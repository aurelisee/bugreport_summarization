Ignoring the leading segments path in manually patching is not intended to be the main reason for patch deployment. It is clarified that path root validation is not required and the right behaviour is described in bug 267003. A warning info should be added in case of adding a path out of the history. A patch is added and some more issues are found, some of them are fixed and remaining will be fixed later.

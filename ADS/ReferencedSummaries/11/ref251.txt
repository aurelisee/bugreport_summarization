A new idea about lsc script for counting lines by applying a regex pattern ^\+? (\s*\S+\s*)+$ and all lines fulfilling this criteria should be summed up and info should be displayed on Apply Path wizard. It is considered as an excellent idea with little modification in regex pattern suggested i.e ^\+\s+\S. A new suggestion about providing information about removed lines like 10 lines added 20 lines removed, is given. Later, the patch is fixed and implemented. In testing it is found that this feature is not working out of box because it is not set as a default for counting lines. The current patch mechanism is not suitable for fixing this problem this it is proposed to avoid it for a while. A new patch makes it possible that if the regular expression is not provided it reads the internal patterns though it works only for some specific formats-- more tests suggested. The latest patch added and test is requested. A clarification is asked while testing as the results were little different from expectation. A new field in the General > Compare/Patch added so that the user can add some custom scripts too. It is further advised that the default mechanism should be as good as possible, besides, there could some additional changes like giving total count along with added and remove lines and modifying regex patterns. The whole summary of all the comments are provided: 1) no counting - rejected 2) count default lines 3) deafult with more sophisticated patterns like excluding empty lines 4) both simple and sophisticated patterns. In the end the final regex pattern is added ^\+[^+]+[a-zA-Z0-9_!?"|@~`$%&()+;,.:<>=+-].

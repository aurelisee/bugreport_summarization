It may be worthwhile to embed a patch that can count lines in the apply patch wizard itself. One proposal is to allow to specify a regexp rule for lines that should be count as a " real contribution ", that is, adopt ">^\+? (\s*\S+\s*)+$ to count only lines starting with single '+' and a space where there is at least one non-whitespace character in the line. It might be a good idea to have one additional kind of regex pattern in the preferences, which acts as a filter -- suggested tooltip behind, for instance, added lines: ^+ ,removed lines: ^- ,filter: ^[+-]\s*$ //filter for lines to not count, e.g. empty lines. In order not to filter any lines from a patch when parsing, the approaches are:1) use only given filters, by default no counting will be made; 2) by default count lines using the simple patterns, which are currently used when parsing a patch (ie " + " and " - " ), this can be modified in the pref page; 3) by default count lines using more sophisticated patterns like excluding empty lines; 4) by default count lines using both simple and sophisticated patterns at the same time. Following regex suppresses lines in the patch from counting, which are empty or only contain non-wordchars or only contain a * as continuation of an empty javadoc comment, so the added lines: ^\+[^+]+[a-zA-Z0-9_!?"|@~`$%()+;,.:=+-] and the removed lines: ^-[^-]+[a-zA-Z0-9_!?"|@~`$%()+;,.:=+-].

The information how many lines does the patch changed should be integrated into the Eclipse SDK as a feature request. The regular expression should be enough to do it, the intuition is easy to do and just sum up the suited lines. The easy way is includ all line start with '+' and a space in the count, but a discussion is open on whether include the empty comments. A removed lines count is also included, and the change is very little. Customers are allowed to input their own regular repression, if not, the patch will use its default expression to count the lines. If the customers input their own regression, they should follow some format and have some backgroud. someone think the empty lines should be count, and others think not. A filter can be added to no count the empty lines. In the pref page, the regular expression can be added. At last, empty or only contain non-wordchars are include in the count.

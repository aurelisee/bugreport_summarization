Even after two updates Help->Check For Updates doesn't find anything but comments says it is fixed, seems to affect windows.

Further testing and nightly builds fixed this issue so it is fixed and verified.Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008050209 Minefield/3.0pre

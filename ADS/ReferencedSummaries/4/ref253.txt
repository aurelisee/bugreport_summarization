In the members calls for flatcomponentdeployable.members there is a call that checks if component.isbinary, if such is the case the code will go on to create modulefile using a java.io.file with no references to the workspace file,our adopter product is breaking because in the case of binary ears with a web module, and this is a change from the way that the old j2eeflexibleprojdeployable used to do it as seen in the j2eeflexibleprojdeployable.members call. To solve the problem, one way is to create attachment 168158, which conditionally changes the modulefile 's constructor. However, there is little risk with this patch.

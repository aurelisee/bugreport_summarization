After delete a file in $profile/extensions,when Mike start tbird ,it still tries to load those components. 
User can uninstall the extension ' s pointer file by selecting uninstall from the em ui and this will add the .autoreg file which will cause the compreg.dat to be rebuilt. 
Darin think thatem is a xpcom component itself.
One solution would be to make xre_main validate the paths in extensions.ini before initializing xpcom. 
After discuss,this is fixed with the extension manager rewrite, also the new component registration makes it impossible to load extension components before profile-after-change now. 
In the future,a situation like this cannot happen with the profile-after-change notification.

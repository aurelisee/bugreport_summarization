On loading CNN and double tapping the paragraph text under the image, no zooming happens, because the zoomToPage is called from the drawInterval after the zoomToElement. 
The fix is to move the _maybeZoomToPage=false to zoomLevel setter, and make it unconditional, while, Other minor functional changes could be remove setting of _maybeZoomToPage in prepareForPanning, maybeZoomToPage and removed Math.max(). 
It is explained that zoomToPage is meant to be called for the duration of page loading, zooming is not supported by current design, use _manuallyZoomed instead. 
check _maybeZoomTopage before the final _endLoad zoomToPage call would fix that and set maybeZoomToPage to false if (_clippedPageDrawing), in zoomToPage thus, the patch suppose to fix the issue.1) load cnn.com
2) double tap on the paragraph of text under the image on the top left

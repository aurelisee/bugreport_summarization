the bug is the actual is different with expected.
expected: zooms to fit paragraph on screen.actual:pans to the top left edge of the paragraph, but no zoom. the reasons about this bug.
this bug was happening because we're calling zoomtopage from the drawinterval after the zoomtoelement.
current design does not support zooming during page load as that zoom setting will be lost as soon as the page loads. 
suggestion for fix.
The fix is to move the _maybezoomtopage=false to zoomlevel setter, and make it unconditional.
i think a better way would be to add a flag like _manuallyzoomed that turns off zoomtopaging during pageload. 
two attachment can fix this bug.
so while we probably do need to fix the zooming-while-loading case, this simpler patch fixes the bug i'm seeing on cnn.1) load cnn.com
2) double tap on the paragraph of text under the image on the top left

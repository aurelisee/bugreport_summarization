Multimessage summary buttons are too long, depends on Gnome system, except delete other buttons are not icon, buttons_have_icons must be set to true to resolve this issue. 
New patch fixed the issue by attaching a palette but it need to be ensured that multimessageview.xhtml is loaded only once however, hread summary toolbar needs some working. 
in second patch buttonbox in multimessageview.css seems to take care of the top padding issue and small update to look all right on OS X but vertical center, and the gradient looks weird also in windows. 
A slightly modified patch making use of child selectors, tried to specify #headingwrapper which fixed the issue.

phenomenon,The buttons for the multimessageview are too big by default. 
This did not happen with 3.0.x.It probably depends on the Gnome system theme. 
Andreas find the true reason and give a fix and a improvement. 
others agree the improvement,Jonathan give a suggestion. 
updata the patch,remove two lines from #buttonbox in multimessageview.css.
But there are still some problems. 
improve twice for the patch,the final version looks good.

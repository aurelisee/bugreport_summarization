The content description can be set to the label which is built the adapter after attempting to adapt the viewer s input to iworkbenchadapter, or be simply set to the result of calling tostring() on the input. One appropriate way to build the content description is would be to use the already available label provider. It is better to do the iworkbenchadapter first and then switch to the label provider if that doesn t work, which gives better local control. If we auto-rebase it, gerrit becomes the committer, but the efoundation is fine with that as they still have the gerrit review record. Mark this bug report as verified with i201306250800.

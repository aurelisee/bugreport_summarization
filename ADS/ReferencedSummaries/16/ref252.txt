ProjectExplorer first use the viewer's input as the contenc description, if isn't success, then call tostring() as input. It should be first use the available label provider, if there isn't, then use IWorkbenchAdapter. The other people think that it should do the IWorkbenchAdapter first, and then the label provider. After discuss, because it gives better local control, the already availabe label provider should be used first. A patch is proposed to fix this bug, and it pass the verify.

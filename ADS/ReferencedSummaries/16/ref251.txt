ProjectExplorer.updateTitle() sets the part's content description by first adapting the viewer's input to IWorkbenchAdapter and later that adapter to build a label, in case of failure description is simply set to the result of calling toString() on the input. It seems like the appropriate way to build the content description would be to use the already available label provider, not directly by the Viewer. It is asked to confirm that if the procedure is correct and patch is pushed for review. The above approach is better and the changes are put to comment but seems there are some problem which later found to be not correct.

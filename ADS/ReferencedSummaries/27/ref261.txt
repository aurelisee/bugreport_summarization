It has been noticed that a 0 bytes file is pushed in log therefore, a test is required to check if it is a legal update. 
The automatic update coincides with AMO and update seems fine but it ran at a different time than the FX update. 
The xml file need to update by hand as the old one is invalid, further testing revealed that the actual file is removed somehow from server. 
It is decided to move forward with blocklist plan and a script will make this easier to fix.

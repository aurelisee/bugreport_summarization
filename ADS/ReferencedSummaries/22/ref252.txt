There is always API errors on the project amd in the problem view when update. Cleaning and rebuilding or replacing will never make it correct, neither close and reopen. Clean may be a way but the problem comes back when you build. The problem is that if API tooling was invoked before replacement, the listener can not be invoked. To fix this problem, first make error a warning, and make this proble have a configurable severity.

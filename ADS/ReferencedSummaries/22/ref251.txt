Updating the o.e.ui.console as a source in a HEAD cause errors, neither cleaning and rebuilding resolves the issue, though it is possible that error go away on clean but this mechanism is used to alert user that they are using wrong builder. A listener detects this problem but when API tooling is enabled so it doesn't work after restart- it is decided to mark the error as warning, also builder has some cleaning problems.

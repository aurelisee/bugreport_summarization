since kopete is a multimessenger and has the idea of metacontacts etc i don t think it s neccessary to display on which network the contact is online (because it doesn t matter), this makes even more sense if you have people who have several different accounts and irc nicks and keeping track of all of them can quite clutter the contact list, so i would simply like an option to turn of the displaying of the tiny icq/irc/etc icons right (or wherever you choose them to be) of the display name, hope this will be done any time soon, thanks for kopete it s such a great app!
in fact, the best way would be to allow a css customisation of the contact list, just as we can have in message windows
i am already considering adding that feature for the next version of kopete
but the current contact list code is quite flexible - flexible enough to allow me to throw together a drag-and-drop style editor for it, at least
fixed in trunk (svn commit 946606) will be in kde 4.3, in trunk user can define contact list layout so you can hide the icons or change order.
version: 0.9.0 (using kde 3.3.0, gentoo)
compiler: gcc version 3.3.3 20040412 (gentoo linux 3.3.3-r6, ssp-3.3.2-2, pie-8.7.6)
os: linux (i686) release 2.6.8-gentoo-r3

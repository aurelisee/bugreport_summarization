previous to m6 dali was a bit flaky when it encountered " corrupt " arrays of nested annotations
@joincolumns({@joincolumn(name= " foo " ), 42, @joincolumn(name= " bar " )}) sometimes dali would seemingly ignore some of the sibling legitimate annotations
sometimes it wouldn ' t (i.e. the legitimate nested annotations would only sometimes show up in the jpa details view)
recent changes to the code for handling nested annotations has caused dali to throw an exception in this situation
this patch attempts to fix both the current exception and the previous flakiness
any " bogus " element in an array of nested annotations will be treated as an empty nested annotations

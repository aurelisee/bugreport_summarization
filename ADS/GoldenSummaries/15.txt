when i create a sequence on my postgresql database then query for it via org.eclipse.datatools.modelbase.sql.schema.schema#getsequences() only an empty collection is returned.
if it fits, i'll come up with other patches for better postgres support. thanks!

patch in egit default format
patch exported without checking git format in egit.
it's odd, but the patch file itself doesn't have any indication inside it as to which projects the patch changes apply
this seems like an egit bug to me
(when creating a patch file with cvs, the patch file includes "#p &lt;plugin name>" records.) i was able to apply the patch, but i had to figure out which changes apply to which plugins, and apply the patch twice.
it would be helpful for future patches to create the patch for one plugin at a time, and indicate which plugin it applies to (perhaps as part of the patch name).
when i applied the changes for the patch, the file updates went into the bug branch, but new files that i had to do an "add" for went into my local master branch
i'll keep my fingers crossed that everything will flow through ok when i merge the bug branch into my local master branch and then push everything to the remote repository.
one way or another, the changes got into my local master.

the splash image on http://gnome.jardigrec.eu/en/ seems to be relative in size to the page size
this causes problems on bigger screens as the image gets very pixelated.
ramon just fixed this one.
this is a problem of the image used, not of plone or the homepage template itself
andreas or someone should define the size of those splash images (i think someone had defined this but it s not documented) and deliver the real splash we are going to have.

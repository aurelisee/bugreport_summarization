expected results: files removed from playlist, audio ceases
stack trace: backtrace was generated from /opt/gnome2/bin/rhythmbox using host libthread_db library /lib/tls/libthread_db.so.1
hmm i cannot trigger this crash on purpose
the trace looks fine anyways.
i haven t been able to reproduce this with 0.9.1cvs from today
marking this fixed.
steps to reproduce: 1. select artist
play a song
2. select all tracks, one of which is currently being played
3. right-click and remove from playlist

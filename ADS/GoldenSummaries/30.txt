the version of flash that ' s shipping on the pre-release tegras is reported as " shockwave flash 9.0 r83 " , but according to vlad that ' s actually a lie (probably for web compat) -- it ' s actually flash lite
we may just want to disable the flash check entirely for windowsce user agents
ideally we ' d actually check against the latest known safe version, but given the opacity of the mobile market i would be surprised if it is (1) difficult to determine what versions are safe and (2) nearly impossible for users to get updates.
it also shouldn ' t warn about nvidia ' s quicktime plugin, which isn ' t really quicktime (it ' s actually just a shim to launch the media in an external player)
having users update to beta 1 and getting a scary warning to update their not-upgradable plugin is a problem.
we may consider pulling the warning overall in lieu of improved visibility to the plugin checker
i assume we ' d just display some kind of polite error message if they go to the plugin check page manually.
the p1 part of this bug is to not pester wince users from the whatsnew page, by whatever means, since we ' ll be shipping on a wince device and it ' ll confuse users
we ' ve delivered windows ce beta 2 builds to our partner, so it ' s critical this be fixed asap

in order to fix bug 334206 and provide input to the compare editor we need to at least provide two rest operations
* status which would return a file with an information on its state (tracked, staged, modified etc)
for modified files the response (json object) should contain a link to the diff
* diff which would return the diff resource for the given file
there s a bug open in jgit to provide a nicer api for diff than using the low-level internals..
bug 334766 - add diffcommand to jgit api if you don t mind using low-level code in jgit, you can look at how we implemented diff in the cli code..
/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/diff.java for status, it s a tad trickier but you can look at how we do it when we decorate resources in the navigator..
i just hope we will be able to stick to the jgit api and don t go back to using egit
we need git diff working via rest api, so libing could start working on the compare editor asap
so it seems like addressing bug 334766, add diffcommand to jgit api is quite important
we had a short discussion with tomek and having git commands implemented is only one part of the problem
we also need a way to add git uris to get /file responses.
i ve just pushed[1] first part of the code which is responsible for the diff operation
if this is not crucial i would like to switch to other missing parts of git rest api[3] like clone
so he will provide additional rest api to get the file from index
the client side will use the diff and the index as input to generate a mapper
git add (on a single file, or all currently unstaged files) git reset --mixed (on a single file, or all currently staged files - the inverse of git add) git commit (passing a commit message, and a boolean for amend or not) i ve asked libing to create a wiki page with a sketch of the ui we d like to build.
i ve just released[1] a rough version of /git/status which returns status for files that
* have been added * are missing -- in index, but not filesystem * have been modified * are not tracked yet

there have been at least two updates since, but help- > check for updates doesn ' t find anything
likely related to bug 431866, but comments there imply that this should be fixed
seems to affect windows as well
linux updates are mia as well
apparently this is related to the underlying issue of bug 431270.
also, this will might just resolve itself when the 20080504 nightlies are available
right now the updates being served are corrupted because there were two builds with the same buildid.
this bug is also affecting more than just mac, which is what bug 431866 was about
fixed now, details to follow shortly.
the tb 1.5.0.14eol nightly build for 20080503 wasn ' t published to the ftp server (it ' s pushing bits to the new staging setup, and that was down for a bit)
the nightly update system was then barfing when it couldn ' t find that complete mar, which blocks partial updates (and forwarding the update information) across the board
the snippets causing the problem where removed to resolve the immediate problem
nightly updates for the fx &amp; tb 1.5.0.x builds have been disabled to prevent it recurring.

intermittently, during start-up, a call to iproject.getadapter(projectresourcelocator.class) will return null with the first call but not null with subsequent calls
the adapter factory is implemented in such a way that it will never return null
so, apparently, the adapter factory is not invoked by the platform adapter manager
if not, can anyone offer any hints as to how we can investigate, sans the debugger, why the platform adapter manager does not invoke the appropriate adapter factory?
it sounds like some kind of race condition where the bundle is not yet active at the time the adapter request comes in, although i don t see how that is possible if you are referencing a class from the plugin providing the adapter before-hand
if suspending in debugger alters the timing, the only debugging technique i can think of is stdout messages in plugin startup, factory instantiation, and adapter lookup to start with.
the root of this issue is in adapterfactoryproxy and its use of the factoryloaded flag
the summary is that factoryloaded can be set to true and accessed by another thread as true before the actual factory has been assigned in the proxy
this results in null being returned for an adapter factory that could be successfully loaded by has not yet been loaded
proposed solution: i have attached a patch that solves the issue by changing when the factoryloaded flag is set to true
the intended behavior of this flag should stay the same and avoid the race condition by setting the factoryloaded flag in a finally block
the adapterfactoryproxy.loadfactory(...) method is synchronized, but the adapterfactoryproxy.getadapter(...) method is not, so we cannot rely on the synchronized loadfactory(...) method to prevent a race condition in relation to the factoryloaded flag.

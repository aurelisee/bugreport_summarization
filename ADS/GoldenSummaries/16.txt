currently, projectexplorer.updatetitle() sets the part s content description (which is displayed at the top of the view s tree whenever the user uses the go into context command to change the tree s root) by first attempting to adapt the viewer s input to iworkbenchadapter and using that adapter to build a label
the resulting label is used for the content description
if this is not successful, the content description is simply set to the result of calling tostring() on the input
it seems like the appropriate way to build the content description would be to use the already available label provider
especially since it seems the purpose of iworkbenchadapter is to be used by a universal label provider, not directly by the viewer.
francis, the only question i have is should it do the iworkbenchadapter first and then switch to the label provider if that doesn t work
i think trying the cn label provider first is better, that gives better local control, so i like the way brian did that
brian, can you verify this is correct in the next nightly or i build and then mark this bug report as verified?
if we auto-rebase it, gerrit becomes the committer, but the efoundation is fine with that as they still have the gerrit review record

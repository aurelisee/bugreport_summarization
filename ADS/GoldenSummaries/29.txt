at least on http://support.mozilla.com/en-us/kb/how+to+contribute, there are a number of images being loaded from external sites
these really, really shouldn ' t be on an external site.
this is caused by and probably a dupe of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=493276 ..
reed offered to put those images somewhere on our infrastructure until that happens.
if sumo 1.2.1 pushes this week, we should be able to move the images to support.mozilla.com, and close this bug this week as well.
i can take care of locating the links to remote images and hosting them on support.mozilla.com.
all remote images in articles are now hosted on support.mozilla.com
everything on support+firefox+day was put up at the last minute for the event, so hosting on an external server was the only option we had
we simply cannot send user data from production websites to personal servers just because it ' s faster/more convenient to do it that way
now, the ability to push reviewed changes to svn and request a push to production by it seems entirely viable, if laura concurs...
i removed the content being loaded from my server on the " support firefox day " and " live chat troubleshooting guide " pages
the live chat screencast is now hosted directly on sumo, and the sfd static video is now embedded directly without the live stream hack
i removed the &lt; form > that was sending data here from the " support firefox day " page, and we should definitely make every effort to avoid sending any data offsite in the future
1) a solid live open video streaming solution
2) some way to implement one-off features that need data we can access
so we had to build an iframe that refreshed itself every minute or so

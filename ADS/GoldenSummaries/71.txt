after updating to kde 4.3.2, kspread does not display spreadsheets
the ui appears, but where it is supposed to render the cells there is just what was on the screen before
kspread cpu usage jumps to 100% the application does not crash, and i can exit it normally with the file menu

as such all software on the machine is compiled from source pretty much in the same way as gentoo
annoyingly, this used to work on an older version of kde
i m sorry that i do not use kspread all that often, so i can t pinpoint exactly when it stopped working for me
the non-appearing spreadsheet / cells issue on kspread was first reported on 2009-10-14 at bug report #210534
it is indeed the same bug

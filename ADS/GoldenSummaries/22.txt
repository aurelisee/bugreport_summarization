i have o.e.ui.console as source in my workspace
when i updated from head i got an api error on the project and in the problems view (a default api profile has not been set for the current workspace)
neither cleaning and rebuilding nor replacing with an earlier version of the project makes the error go away
i then tried to close and reopen - no luck
it ' s possible the error does go away on clean - but probably comes back as soon as you build
this is to alert users that are using api tooling that they need to set up a baseline, else the tooling will not do binary compatible checks
interesting - we have a listener that looks for this (i.e. changing project nature to no longer have api tooling)
so if you did this immediately after a workspace re-start, the code would not be invoked (as the listener would not be registered).
for this one, i think we should start by marking the error a warning (i.e. no baseline set up)
this way, users can load projects from cvs and still use them without errors (and without using api tooling binary compatibility analysis)
we do clean problems if your remove the builder and api tooling is " loaded " , but is possible to start a workspace with problems and replace from head without ever invoking our builder/tooling

inspired by martin oberhuber ' s mail about his " lsc " script for counting lines in a patch[1], i though that it maybe be worthwhile to embed such thing in the apply patch wizard itself
so, my proposal is to allow to specify a regexp rule for lines that should be count as a " real contribution "
^\+? (\s*\S+\s*)+$
all lines that match the above pattern would be sum up and the info would be displayed somewhere on the apply patch wizard
my script also ignores " empty comment " lines of the form ^\+\s+[#*] +\s+$ but that ' s really neglectible and i ' m fine with your approach of counting any non-empty added line in the patch
and actually, if the wizard counts added lines, why shouldn ' t it also count removed lines
i decided to leave them blank by default, so i don ' t need to worry about different diff output formats which are out there
so i don ' t quite understand why the same patterns that compare/patch already uses aren ' t the default for the line counting feature.
i guess you ' re right martin, but this will make the patch a little bit more complicated as the current patching mechanism is not very helpful in counting added/removed lines
the latest patch ensures, that when no regular expressions is provided, the patcher will use internal patterns to distinguish which lines have been added or deleted
however, this will work only for patches in unified and context diff output format
it looks like you are also counting empty lines, which doesn ' t seem overly useful to me.
it ' s awsome that this is customizeable, but when i remember right, one reason for putting this enhancement into eclipse sdk was such that there is a " common standard " by which the projects count their lines in a patch
on the other hand, having some magic like removing empty lines from the count going on in the background is perhaps a problem..
actually, it might be a good idea to have one additional kind of regex pattern in the preferences, which acts as a filter -- suggested tooltip behind //
filter: ^[+-]\s*$ //filter for lines to not count, e.g. empty lines
martin, i see your point when you ' re saying that the " common standard " should be as good as possible, however i would rather not to filter any lines from a patch when parsing
here are the approaches so far
1) use only given filters, by default no counting will be made
2) by default count lines using the simple patterns, which are currently used when parsing a patch (ie " + " and " - " ), this can be modified in the pref page
3) by default count lines using more sophisticated patterns like excluding empty lines
fyi, following regex suppresses lines in the patch from counting, which are empty or only contain non-wordchars (i.e. lines which only contain an }
or only contain a * as continuation of an empty javadoc comment

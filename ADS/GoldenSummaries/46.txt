i needed to uninstall it because it was causing the most recent nightlies to crash on startup (nsacstring symbol mismatch), so i deleted the file
when i start tbird, though, it still tries to load those components, because we have an xpcom-startup observer, which references the native libs, etc
manually removing the entry from extensions.ini let it start up, notice that the path-file was gone, and get on with its life
mike, you can uninstall the extension ' s pointer file by selecting uninstall from the em ui and this will add the .autoreg file which will cause the compreg.dat to be rebuilt
the problem is that em is a xpcom component itself..
and it is not something that ns_initxpcom2 knows about
one solution would be to make xre_main validate the paths in extensions.ini before initializing xpcom
if an extension is set to be disabled or uninstalled then it will also set all extensions that depend on it to be disabled before restart and the .autoreg is generated, etc
it seems it would be simpler / faster to just enumerate the registry install locations on startup to see if there are changes (perhaps dir existence / last modified time?) especially since there are very few extensions that use registry install locations
this is fixed with the extension manager rewrite, also the new component registration makes it impossible to load extension components before profile-after-change now.
so marking as verified fixed based on the changes happened to the component registration and the observers.

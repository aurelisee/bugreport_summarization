seahorse 2.27.5 is not displaying the password tab and thus i am unable to view or delete network passwords or wireless secrets
launching seahorse from the terminal results in the following related errors: $ seahorse
** (seahorse:3910): critical **: initialize_tab: assertion self->pv->tabs[tabid].widget != null failed
see this in fedora rawhide as well: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=515263
looks like the moving the passwords tab didn t quite fully happen, and instead it sort of got removed
this happened during the migration to gtkbuilder..
the commit above happened shortly after the migration.

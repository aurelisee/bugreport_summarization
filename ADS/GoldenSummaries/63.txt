everytime one connects to some kind of protocol the gui freezes (if you re offline it will be freezed until it timed out), the gui will also freeze for a short time if one joins/parts some irc channel, if the load is low this won t be noticed much, but there seems to be some kind of operation running which completely freezes the gui, imho this should run in the background and leave the rest of the gui responsible.
i think this has been fixed in kde 3.3 with the new socket api
just icq and jabber, i don t connect them at startup but only when i use them, if i connect them both at the same time i can t notice any blocked ui, so from my part this bug is fixed
it works fine when i connect only one account at a time, but freezes 2 times over 3 trials when trying to connect all my accounts (1 yahoo, 2 msn, 1 jabber, 1 icq, 2 gg, 1 aim) at the same time
it doesn t only lag, it simply freezes and i have to kill kopete and start again.

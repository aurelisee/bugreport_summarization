when reading a freshly received mail, a conflict dialog pop ups
there is no indication that its a conflict dialog, though (only titled kmail mobile )
the conflicting fields are modification time and flags (\seen)
apply the same sparse item optimization we already have in kmail desktop when marking as read, should eventually go into messageviewer and happen after message downloading though

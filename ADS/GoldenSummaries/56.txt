when closing the composer in which a mail is composed that does not yet has an recipient, a question pops up ( discard/save as draft )
if save as draft is selected, a message is shown ( no recipient found ...you should specify at least one recipient...) and the mail ist lost
however, both test have in common that you need to specify a recipient whereas in kmail desktop version it is possible to save as draft without specifying a recipient (unknown is then displayed as the recipient)
the email is correctly stored in the save as draft folder (local folders)
however, when the user tries to reopen it in a composer a delete draft error pop up message appears
can not delete draft
this error message does not make sense so i have reported a different bug about that (see bug #251511)
it is corrected now
it is possible to save as draft an email without a recipient, subject or text
after clicking on ok in the pop up dialogue asking the user to specify a recipient the composer closes and the email is lost instead of saved as draft
this seems incoherent with the save as draft functionality that i tested today and which works fine
- launch kmail mobile
- click on write new email button
- after entering a subject and a few words, open the actions tab and click on save as draft
- a no recipients found - kmail mobile pop up dialogue opens with the following message you should specify at least one recipient for this message
- click on ok
- the user can open the actions tab and specify the recipient s email
- and then click on send the email is properly save as a draft and stored in the draft folder

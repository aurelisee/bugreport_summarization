configure allows to define the sendmail-location and sets the variable mailer accordingly
this variable is however never passed to the mail plug-in
to make things worse, i fear i recently broke the configure check in the stable tree
i have just fixed this problem in the head branch
merged the changes from the head branch.
the fix is part of the stable release 1.2.4

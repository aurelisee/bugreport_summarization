the online/offline icons are done in the old gnome style and doesn t match the rest of the icons in the interface.
created an attachment (id=116411)
new online and offline icons + svg sources
i raise priority as there is patch and ui freeze is near
even mclasen isn t sure, but he thinks gtk should preserve the aspect ratio if we put it in 32x32
i think i would just replace the old bitmap with this one for 2.24 and look for a better solution in the next cycle.
here s a complete patch
i put the images into 32x32 and gtk found the icon names alright, but i had to load them by filename to prevent gtk from scaling them down to a 16x16
i want this for 2.24, but it may require screenshot updates from our beloved docs team.
committed to trunk (revision 35995).

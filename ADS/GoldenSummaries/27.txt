was browsing the hg pushlog, and happened to check what got pushed..
looks like it accidentally the whole file
indeed, it s a 0-byte file in my tree
[note that, at the moment, mxr s index is like a week stale, so if you check on mxr it looks like the file is still ok] probably also need either a test in the script to make sure it s a legit looking update, and/or a test in the tree to blow up if the update s bad?
can we trigger the update now to get things right in the tree again then figure out a way to avoid it in the future
the next automatic update will occur in just a few hours (early saturday), that said i am bumping severity
also for ref, suite/ s update was fine (but i know it ran at a much different time than fx s update) http://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/c15ed4c2c86d
if we want to take a blocklist update there, we ll need someone to land the update by hand there too.
i thought we had a=blocklist-update in the script [at least the version seamonkey currently uses has that.] if it was removed somehow, i d suggest adding it back in, fwiw.
we turned that switch off to prevent this kind of thing on 1.9.2, our mainline stable branch at the time
no, but if the blocklist gets updated after it leaves m-c, it will be a manual process, where manual could mean releng triggers the update provided we have blocklist updates enabled on that branch
this handles the proximate problem of accidentally importing an empty file as a blocklist
as noted before, we could have this blocklist update builder available on those branches for releng to trigger, i.e. it won t necessary fall to someone to update the blocklist by hand, although the script would make that trivial.

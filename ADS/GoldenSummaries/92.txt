stack trace: starting program: /usr/bin/seahorse [thread debugging using libthread_db enabled] [new thread 0xb7048700 (lwp 16727)]
program received signal sigsegv, segmentation fault
this should be fixed with this commit
but the key does not get deleted either so its still not the expected behaviour
just fixed related bug #551377
1. open seahorse
2. right-mouse-click a ssh-key and select delete
3. crash

in the dolphin s places panel if i press in the pc floppy drive icon it mount s the floppy but dolphin doesn t change the directory location to the floppy one
the second time i press over the pc floppy drive icon in the places panel it seems that try again to mount the floppy drive (although it is already mounted), also doesn t change the directory location and shows an error message in the status bar which says
besides that, if i manually go to /media/floppy with dolphin it displays and manages correctly the contents inside the floppy disk
another thing, that when the floppy drive it is mounted, there is no way to unmount with dolphin, if i right click over the pc floppy drive icon in the dolphin s panel only appears a hide option
hej, that s a bug in hal, which provides an empty volume.mount_point property for floppy discs instead of the real path

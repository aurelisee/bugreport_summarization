when i update today (0708) from yesterday ' s nightly, i get to download the new build, but after restart it doesn ' t apply anything (no patching window comes up, no messages on the console or js console)
i tried running updater.app by hand as well, and didn ' t get anything
not sure if this is just the server being mistaken about there being newer builds for me, or what, but i thought i ' d file it.
after i restart, the update archive gets deleted, but i never get the " updating firefox " window, and the build is the same old one
is active-update.xml supposed to be deleted after the update is applied
if so, that ' s the problem, since it ' s still there after an update
active-update.xml that was left around after applying updates
however, i also see that active-updates.xml is still in the application directory after the update
i also see an active-updates.xml file under windows, but its contents are significantly different (just an empty xml tag).
i just tried removing active-updates.xml and that didn ' t seem to help
in fact, i can ' t seem to find the .mar file from the second update cycle anywhere on my hdd.
when i deleted the entire updates/ folder, the problem went away, and i was able to update from the 7/29 build to today ' s 8/1 build
yeah, i think it ' s having trouble removing updates/0/updater.app/ because it does not expect that to be a directory
under other systems (linux and windows), it is not a directory
the solution is probably to change nsupdateservice.js to pass |true| to the nsifile

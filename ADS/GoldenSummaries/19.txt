i20050928-1300 the menu ' fully qualify duplicates ' in the open type dialog does not affect the qualification (which is always on for duplicates) but actually appends the container info.
i agree that the names are quite confusing
' fully qualified ' normally means including package
here it means including container info
suggestion ' show container for duplicates ' this conflicts with the ' show container info ' which i would call, ' show status line ' dirk, why is the first option only for duplicates
the feature works as follows
- if fully qualify duplicates is unchecked two types with the same name are qualified until they " name " is unique
- if fully qualify duplicates is checked two types with the same name are are alqays qualified with the full container path
i was interpreting ' fully qualify ' as the package qualification only and hence expected that ' fully qualify duplicates ' would affect the package qualification for duplicates which it doesn ' t
i also like martin ' s suggestion to rename the other item ' show status line '
this would make it clear and would even allow to remove the separator, making the menu smaller and nicer.
fixed by changing the names and reordering the menu.
setting to verified.

+++ this bug was initially created as a clone of bug #472411 +++ tracemonkey talos is skipping revisions, making it impossible to use the talos reports to effectively determine when performance regressions occurred, and dramatically slowing down work on some parts of 3.1
i ' m requesting that additional talos hardware be deployed to triple the bandwidth available to tracemonkey talos on at least windows and mac, as soon as it can be acquired
the difficulty of setting up an accurate talos environment on an individual developer ' s machine compounds the problem in an unfortunate way.) can someone please update this bug with an eta on hardware arrival and machine deployment
can i get an idea of when this set up was under load
when i went to check to see how far behind things had fallen i found several idle talos machine and no queue in sight
there were, however, three talos boxes that had been marked as hidden on the waterfall and were not being displayed
over the weekend, mostly, i believe, when we were trying to track down talos crashes and so forth by bisecting our changeset history
if they ' ve been hidden it can be resolved through the tinderbox admin page - unfortunately, there ' s a bug in tinderbox wherein if machines have fallen off the waterfall due to idle time they are sometimes re-added as hidden when they do their new report
having hidden boxes does not mean that the talos boxes themselves were idle
07 got a talos run and the other two didn ' t, fits pretty well with how it ' s been explained to me, that the poller runs every ten minutes, and takes only the newest of the builds which it hasn ' t seen before, so that with lucky polling those three might have produced two (but not three) talos runs, but they weren ' t that lucky
(then there ' s the question of whether cross-machine numbers are really good enough to say that if tss was 173.74 before your patch, on qm-plinux-trunk04, and 177.38 with your patch, on qm-plinux-trunk05, then that means you regressed it as opposed to meaning that trunk05 is a hair slower or had one bad run, but luckily that ' s not my problem.)
i ' ve added text to the top of each tinderbox waterfalls for mozilla-central, mozilla-1.9.1 and tracemonkey giving a count of machines for each project branch
* if the count does not match what you can see on the waterfall, then ask the sheriff to see if any machines are hidden
* if the count still does not match up, file a bug in mozilla.org

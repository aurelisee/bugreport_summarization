in workbench.init() we read the source providers of the ' org.eclipse.ui.services ' extension point and there all extensions are immediately loaded (createexecutableextension) no matter whether the contributing bundle is already started
unfortunately this happens before the workbench itself is correctly initialized (workbench colors in this particular case)
this can cause troubles for upstream bundles that expect the workbench colors and/or fonts to be present when they get loaded
it would be good if the workbench could initialize as much as possible before calling code that starts other bundles
we should either - protect the code to not load those extensions
- initialize default services after colors and fonts (this might be the simplest fix but would need extensive testing).
this patch allows to reproduce the problem
i could move the actual instantiation to the same place as the early startup extensions

this fix caused a major issue, see bug 316701.
1. load ' org.eclipse.jdt.ui ' from cvs with tag=v20100316-0800
2. start a target workspace == > boom!

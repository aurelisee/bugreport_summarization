when the configure script does not find the version of the libraries it needs, it reports the libraries missing, in stead of too old
expected results: your installed versions of $library is too old, please upgrade to at least $required version
it s poor form to release software as stable when it depends upon libraries that have not yet been marked as stable.
we cannot do much about this because the pkgconfig macro from cmake simply says whether it has found a suitable version or not
if not, it does not tell which version was found but wasn t sufficient.
actually i think it would be better if kde would switch to the new cmake pkgconfig wrapper
i prefer to keep things simple as well
it would be better for the pkgconfig wrapper to be used in kde.
version: 1.3.0 (using kde 4.4.4)
os: linux
steps to reproduce: compile digikam 1.3.0

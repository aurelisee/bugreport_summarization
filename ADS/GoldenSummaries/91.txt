every time i click on a launcher on second screen's applet gnome-panel crashes using nvidia's propietary drivers without xinerama or twinview
i think the crash happens because the launcher animation window is created with the default (wrong) screen.
in ubuntu hardy there was no problem, so i would assume this bug entered the source somewhere between the hardy and intrepid release.
the patch from gerd kohlberger fixes the issue.
version: 2.24.0

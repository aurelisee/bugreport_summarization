the account wizards runs through fine and complains if i enter wrong passwords, but the accounts do not show up in the tree view
the accounts do however show up in the account view in the actions flap.
may be duplicate of https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=248554 and fixed in newer versions.
it showed up immediately in the accounts list, but not in the tree-view.
the accounts i added where empty accounts (no folders, few/none mails)
after i created a folder and moved a mail into it (using kontact stationary), the account showed up in kmail-mobile
i suspect the flaw exists for the other apllications (adress, kalendar, notes), too
sorry, but i disagree with that solution
obviously, the kolab wizard has to handle that correctly by adding the domain part to the username (and it does that already)
but adding kolab-specific workarounds to the generic imap wizard is wrong imho
most non-kolab imap servers i know don t require a domain part in the username, and keep in mind that this is only about the pre-filled value in the username field anyway, in case you have a different username than the suggested default you have to edit it.

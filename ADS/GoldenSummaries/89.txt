we need a 256x256 variant for various places in gnome shell
also included is source svg using the one canvas approach.
plese note that the source svg needs to be kept in the repository, no need to ship it with the tomboy source package tho.
slightly refesh d version with more contrast and better canvas usage on the 256x256.

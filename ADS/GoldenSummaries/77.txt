backtrace was generated from /usr/libexec/evolution-data-server-1.8
hope i have all the needed -debuginfo packages now.
the backtrace is different, and the original one posted is from a much older evolution version
but if you followed precisely the steps described in the other report and could trigger the crash you should leave a comment there telling that.
note, that bug 449609 and it s dups (and their dups) look related to that issue, although they are a year younger than this bug here.

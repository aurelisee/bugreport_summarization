result: when i returned to my machine, all of my 2gb of ram was claimed by amarok, the cpu was still at 100% and my swap was thrashing madly
conclusion: seems to me that amarok is trying to load every song in my collection in to ram before starting to move them
expected behaviour: amarok should be able to deal with huge amounts of files gracefully
targeting this for 2.0.1 as it s a pretty important feature (and many people are going to want to organize their entire collection, so it will probably effect the masses.)
amarok does not eat up huge amounts of memory anymore
collection management still leaves a little to be desired, though
i suppose that will have to go into usability bugs
i was able to move around 20gb worth of songs from a directory to my collection.
version: (using kde 4.1.2)
compiler: gcc 4.3.2 -march=native -o2 -pipe
os: linux
to reproduce: right-click on my local collection, and then pick organize files
ticked sort by file type, and replace spaces with underscores, restrict to ascii
then clicked on continue
the amarok gui becomes completely unusable, and when switching between screens and back it does not redraw

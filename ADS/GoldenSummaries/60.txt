similar to https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=248775 , when attempting to send a message without a configured transport
this results in two notifications
error while trying to send email
there were problems and e-mail successfully sent
these notifications should not appear together
the email is afterwards lost (not found in outbox or sent-mail).
imho, its not fully the (the other issue is more sent-mail and malformed adress - centric)
probably the intermediate cause for the conflicting notifications is
instead, just the error message is shown
0) start kmail-mobile
1) open composer ( write new mail )
2) open action flap->configure transport
3) press delete for every transport
4) add recipient, enter subject and text for the mail
5) press send

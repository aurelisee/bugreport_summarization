i20060110-1026 i can no longer click some elements in the packages view and suddenly the label gets corrupted into" org.ec.."
this works with i200605-0800 plus jdt ' s build input for i20060110-1026
this used to happen back in the 3.0 days (bug 56593) when we explicitly set the font on a particular item...
moving to swt since this looks like a regression at the swt level
boris, i saw that a new labledecorator got added with i20060110-1026
would you be able to send me a screenshot of the bug
it seems to be modifying the name that was last selected before clicking on another view
actually, it turned out to be caused by the fix for bug 119207.
verified in 3.2 m5 (i20060217-1115).

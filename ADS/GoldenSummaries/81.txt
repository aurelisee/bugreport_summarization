in the gimp module we have multiple text domains and maintain multiple po directories
in each of these, intltool-update -m detects a long list of files that are missing from potfiles.in
we would like to fix this but maintaining the potfiles.skip files would be quite a pain
it would make our lifes a lot easier if potfiles.skip could contain directory names and intltool-update would then skip the listed directory entirely
the gnome-games module is also annoyed by this bug.
no matter whether this problem should be fixed in this way or by any other mean, allowing directory to be skipped could be a good thing to add for intltool.
you can now ignore directories by simply placing the directory name in potfiles.skip
we are now using this feature in gimp trunk
seems to work nicely with intltool 0.40.0
it makes maintaining the potfiles.skip files a lot easier.

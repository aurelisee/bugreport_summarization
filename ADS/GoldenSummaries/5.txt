in an adopter product, while executing tests scenarios using 3.0m5, we found the following jvm lock which seems to be caused by two threads accessing some faceted framework code
we will need a patch for based on m5 code for this defect
i will need the stack trace of both threads unless this can be reproduced with wtp alone.
it happens to be running in the context of a facetedproject.modify() operation kicked off by adopter code, which is holding a project lock
a simple solution here might be to spin off a thread from the start method instead
because the projects are still locked during change notification, any delegating facet or runtime changed operation will be locked out - causing this situation.
modified facetedprojectframeworkimpl.create() method so that the projects list is not held while the project refresh is called
released the fix into the 3.0 m6 code stream.

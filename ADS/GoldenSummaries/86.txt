if /desktop/gnome/interface/buttons_have_icons is set to false i still get a icon on the add... button in the font &amp; colors preferences tab
this seems to work on the remove button though, so maybe they are implemented differently.
created an attachment (id=139723) screenshot of preferences window
should be fixed on trunk now.

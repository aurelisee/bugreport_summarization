now, with imap messages (i m not using pop so i can t tell), sending a message now goes like this
- a fake header is created while..
the fake header is wrongly indexed (see bug 646225), but the real header is absolutely, never, ever indexed
i think i m seeing alternatively both this issue and 574441
if my theory is correct, since we re not altering the msgdbhdr, restarting thunderbird should be enough for an indexing pass to kick in and index all the sent messages that hadn t been indexed previously
my sent messages go to inbox, and i too have found that restart gets them indexed
comment on attachment 530415 proposed fix i just gave this patch a try, and gloda is seeing msgsclassified for the fake header, which means it is indexed instantly (this is great)
this also means asuth s code from bug 534449 will be actually used properly, because afaict, we were only going through this codepath with buggy assumptions before, or not going there at all!

this way other files load and comparison starts while i review the changes of the first file
now, my problem is that when i switch to another compare editor, the file is not automatically selected in the synchronize view
add the synchronize view as ' show in ' target 2
add the commonly known ' link with editor ' tool bar button and/or view menu item
if i ' ve understood you correctly after you switch to another compare editor the several files you clicked on in the sync view are still selected
patch that adds linking when sync ' ed using workspace model (i guess with models turned off it will work as well)
it ' s still missing couple of things
for me yes, and since it ' s limited scope i would probably not even add a toolbar button but simply add it to the view menu.
and put it back on the toolbar with the other bug as soon as linking starts to work for all synchronizations (i.e. including models)?
so a button in view-toolbar would be useful
yes me too, but i guess i won ' t toggle it often in the sync view, e.g. i also never disable it in the history view
added iworkbenchcommandconstants.navigate_toggle_link_with_editor as actiondefinitionid for togglelinkingaction.
final version of the patch to be committed simultaneously with fixes for bug 291215, bug 291214 and bug 291213.

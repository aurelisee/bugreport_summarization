when creating a new webproject, i created a new runtime but i was unable to see in the drop down the newly created runtime
i then created a second one, i was then able to see the first one, but not the second newly created runtime
i just tried this again today using the latest build available (20080104023442), and i am still able to recreate the problem
the one thing i did noticed that i did is i skipped step 0, and instead added a step 2.1, where i just click on the drop down arrow of the target runtime (this way i ensure that there is nothing in the box), i then continue with step 3, using tomcat 5.5
raising severity to major since this can be a pretty confusing regression for the user to deal with
i have a patch for this issue and bug 214375 (they are interconnected)
both issues appear to be fixed by the patch, but due to the size of the change, this will need further testing/review before being released.
0. ensure you don ' t have any installed server (runtimes) defined
1. open the create new dynamyc web project wizard
2. enter the name for the web project
3. using the target runtime " new " button, create a new runtime
4. the runtime should be displayed in the combobox, but is not there
i was using tomcat 5.5

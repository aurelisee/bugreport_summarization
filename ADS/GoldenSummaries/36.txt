expected: zooms to fit paragraph on screen actual
pans to the top left edge of the paragraph, but no zoom
this bug was happening because we ' re calling zoomtopage from the drawinterval after the zoomtoelement (which also explains why it was intermittent - if you wait until the page load is done, everything is fine)
the fix is to move the _maybezoomtopage=false to zoomlevel setter, and make it unconditional
current design does not support zooming during page load as that zoom setting will be lost as soon as the page loads(even with your hack)
i think a better way would be to add a flag like _manuallyzoomed that turns off zoomtopaging during pageload.
we only set maybezoomtopage to false if (_clippedpagedrawing), in zoomtopage
zooming while loading *is* in fact busted, but the reason i was actually seeing this is that once loaded, addtodrawq still calls resizeandpaint, and that can trigger a sizetopage if _maybezoomtopage is still true
so while we probably do need to fix the zooming-while-loading case, this simpler patch fixes the bug i ' m seeing on cnn.
created attachment 361437 fix
i think this fixes the bug.
1) load cnn.com
2) double tap on the paragraph of text under the image on the top left

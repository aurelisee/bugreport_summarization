this leads to a crash when the first entry is played again and attempted to eleminate.
i suspect this is a duplicate of bug #131150 which just got fixed today
this was happening because the entry was being deleted while it still had outstanding changes
the deletion signal was emitted immediately (removing the entry from all sources), then the changes were emitted on the next rhythmdb_commit, which re-added the entry to any sources it had been in
this patch delays the entry deleted signal until the next rhythmdb_commit, like all other changes
all rhythmdb_entry_delete calls except one already had rhythmdb_commit calls immediately afterwards
purge playlist
add two files
play the first entry
right-lick it and select eleminate
playback skips to the next song but the entry is not visibly removed
